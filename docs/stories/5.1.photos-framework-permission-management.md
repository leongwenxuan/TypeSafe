# Story 5.1: Photos Framework Integration & Permission Management

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** companion app,  
**I want** to request and manage Photos library access,  
**so that** I can automatically fetch screenshots for scanning (Epic 5).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. App requests Photos library permission on first launch (after onboarding)
2. Permission request message clearly explains automatic screenshot scanning
3. Handles all permission states: authorized, limited, denied, notDetermined
4. Falls back to manual picker if permission denied
5. Allows users to re-request permissions from Settings screen
6. Permission status cached and checked before automatic fetching
7. Works with both "All Photos" and "Limited Photos" access modes
8. Complies with iOS privacy guidelines and App Store review requirements

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 3.8 (Privacy Controls & Settings) - COMPLETED:**
- SettingsManager and AppSettings infrastructure established
- App Group synchronization patterns for keyboard settings
- Privacy-first design with user toggles and data controls
- Settings UI framework with sections for privacy controls
- Existing photo permission handling in ScanView (manual picker flow)

**From Story 4.1 (Screenshot Detection) - COMPLETED:**
- Screenshot detection via UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification
- ScreenshotNotification data model with timestamp and expiration
- App Group storage for screenshot notifications
- Settings toggle: `screenshotDetectionEnabled` (default: ON)

**From Story 4.2 (Screenshot Alert Prompt) - COMPLETED:**
- Keyboard banner system for screenshot notifications
- Deep linking via URL scheme: `typesafe://scan`
- Settings toggle: `screenshot_scan_prompts_enabled` (default: ON)
- 60-second notification expiration and cleanup

### Architecture Context

**[Source: docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]**
- Companion App: "Scan My Screen" entrypoint; receives user-selected screenshot
- Run Apple Vision OCR locally (VNRecognizeTextRequest)
- Upload OCR text + (optionally) the image to backend for analysis
- Show history (last 5 results) and settings (privacy, voice)

**[Source: docs/architecture/security-privacy.md]**
- Local-first: OCR on-device; screenshot upload is opt-in
- App Group: secure shared container for keyboard↔app flags only
- Compliance: App Store privacy manifest; easy "Delete my data" action
- Minimization: send only small text snippets; screenshots optional

**[Source: docs/prd/epic-5-automatic-screenshot-scanning.md]**
- Permission requested only when feature is used (not on app launch)
- Clear explanation in permission prompt
- User control via Settings toggle: "Automatic Screenshot Scanning"
- Falls back gracefully if permission denied
- Only fetches screenshots when user explicitly taps "Scan Now"
- No background photo access

### Photos Framework Permission Management

**Permission Request Strategy:**
- Request permission when user first taps "Scan Now" from keyboard banner (Story 5.2)
- Alternatively, user can pre-authorize from Settings screen
- Never request on app launch (Apple privacy guideline)
- Permission prompt should clearly explain the purpose

**iOS Permission Levels:**
```swift
// PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for: .readWrite)
case .notDetermined:     // Not yet requested
case .authorized:        // Full access granted
case .limited:           // User selected specific photos only
case .denied:            // User denied access
case .restricted:        // Parental controls or device policy
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```swift
import Photos

class PhotosPermissionManager: ObservableObject {
    @Published var authorizationStatus: PHAuthorizationStatus = .notDetermined
    
    /// Request Photos library access with clear messaging
    func requestAuthorization() async -> PHAuthorizationStatus {
        let status = await PHPhotoLibrary.requestAuthorization(for: .readWrite)
        await MainActor.run {
            self.authorizationStatus = status
        }
        return status
    }
    
    /// Check current authorization status
    func checkAuthorizationStatus() -> PHAuthorizationStatus {
        let status = PHPhotoLibrary.authorizationStatus(for: .readWrite)
        self.authorizationStatus = status
        return status
    }
    
    /// Returns true if automatic fetching is possible
    var canAutomaticallyFetchScreenshots: Bool {
        return authorizationStatus == .authorized || authorizationStatus == .limited
    }
}
```

### Settings Integration

**New Settings Property:**
Add to `AppSettings.swift`:
```swift
/// Enable automatic screenshot scanning (default: ON) - Story 5.1
var automaticScreenshotScanEnabled: Bool = true
```

**Settings Toggle Location:**
Add to SettingsView privacy section (between screenshot detection and voice alerts):
```swift
Section("Screenshot Scanning") {
    Toggle("Automatic Screenshot Scanning", isOn: $settings.automaticScreenshotScanEnabled)
        .onChange(of: settings.automaticScreenshotScanEnabled) { newValue in
            SettingsManager.shared.updateAutomaticScanSetting(newValue)
        }
    
    Text("When enabled, tapping 'Scan Now' automatically fetches your most recent screenshot. Requires Photos access.")
        .font(.caption)
        .foregroundColor(.secondary)
    
    // Show permission status
    if !photosPermissionGranted {
        Button("Grant Photos Access") {
            requestPhotosPermission()
        }
        .font(.subheadline)
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
    }
}
```

**SettingsManager Extension:**
Add to `SettingsManager.swift`:
```swift
/// Updates automatic screenshot scan setting (Story 5.1)
func updateAutomaticScanSetting(_ enabled: Bool) {
    settings.automaticScreenshotScanEnabled = enabled
    saveSettings()
    
    // Sync to App Group for keyboard awareness
    appGroupDefaults?.set(enabled, forKey: "automatic_screenshot_scan_enabled")
}
```

### Info.plist Configuration

**CRITICAL: Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription:**
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>TypeSafe needs access to your photos to automatically scan screenshots for scams when you tap "Scan Now" from the keyboard. We only access the most recent screenshot when you request a scan.</string>
```

**Privacy Manifest Update:**
Update PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy to include:
- Photos library access purpose (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription)
- Clearly state: "Access only when user taps Scan Now"
- Document automatic screenshot fetch feature

### Permission Flow Diagram

```text
User Journey: First-Time Automatic Scan

1. User takes screenshot while typing
2. Keyboard banner appears: "Screenshot taken - Scan for scams?"
3. User taps "Scan Now" button
4. App opens via typesafe://scan?auto=true (Story 5.2)
5. App checks Photos permission:
   
   IF notDetermined:
     → Show permission request with clear messaging
     → User taps "Allow" or "Don't Allow"
     → IF allowed: Proceed to automatic fetch (Story 5.2)
     → IF denied: Fall back to manual picker
   
   IF authorized/limited:
     → Proceed to automatic fetch (Story 5.2)
   
   IF denied/restricted:
     → Show error banner with "Settings" button
     → Fall back to manual picker (existing flow)
```

### Permission States Handling

**Authorized (Full Access):**
- Can fetch all screenshots
- Automatic scanning fully functional
- Best user experience

**Limited (Selected Photos):**
- User has selected specific photos to share
- Screenshots may not be available in selection
- Fall back to manual picker if screenshot not found
- Show helpful message: "Screenshot not available - please grant full photo access for automatic scanning"

**Denied/Restricted:**
- Cannot access photo library programmatically
- Show clear error message with "Settings" button
- Always fall back to manual PhotosPicker (existing Story 3.2 flow)
- User can still manually select photos to scan

**Not Determined:**
- First-time request when tapping "Scan Now"
- Show system permission prompt with clear message
- Handle user response (authorized/denied)

### Error Messaging

**Permission Denied:**
```swift
"Photos access is required for automatic scanning. To enable automatic screenshot scanning, please allow Photos access in Settings."

[Open Settings] [Use Manual Picker]
```

**Limited Access (Screenshot Not Found):**
```swift
"Your screenshot isn't available in Limited Photos selection. For automatic scanning, grant full Photos access or select the screenshot manually."

[Grant Full Access] [Select Manually]
```

**Screenshot Not Found (Even with Permission):**
```swift
"Screenshot not found in your photo library. It may have been deleted or is older than 60 seconds. Opening manual picker..."

[OK - Opens PhotosPicker]
```

### Privacy Considerations

**Apple App Store Review Guidelines:**
- ✅ Clear permission prompt message (NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription)
- ✅ Permission requested only when feature is used (not on launch)
- ✅ Fallback to manual picker if permission denied
- ✅ User control via Settings toggle
- ✅ Transparent about when photos are accessed
- ✅ No background photo access
- ✅ Only fetches when user taps "Scan Now"

**User Trust & Transparency:**
- Clear explanation of why Photos access is needed
- Visible Settings toggle with description
- Graceful fallback preserves functionality
- No surprise permission requests
- Respects user privacy choices

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**
- Test PhotosPermissionManager authorization flow
- Mock PHPhotoLibrary for isolated testing
- Test all permission state transitions
- Test Settings integration and toggle behavior

**Manual Testing:**
1. Fresh app install → Verify permission NOT requested on launch
2. Tap "Scan Now" from keyboard → Verify permission prompt appears
3. Grant "All Photos" → Verify automatic scanning works (Story 5.2)
4. Reset permission → Grant "Limited Access" → Test fallback behavior
5. Reset permission → Deny access → Verify manual picker fallback
6. Toggle "Automatic Scanning" OFF → Verify always uses manual picker
7. Open Settings → Verify "Grant Photos Access" button works
8. Test across iOS 16.0, 16.4, 17.0, 17.2 versions

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end: Screenshot → Banner → Scan Now → Permission → Fetch (Story 5.2)
- Test permission state persistence across app launches
- Test Settings synchronization with keyboard extension
- Test error states and fallback flows
