# Epic 6: Bug Fixes - Color and Layout Issues

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## Issues Reported

### Issue 1: Blue Text Colors on Initial Load
**Symptom:** When pulling up the keyboard initially, letters appear in blue text on black background instead of the intended gray/white scheme.

**Root Cause:** 
- `createKeyButton()` was using `UIButton(type: .system)` which applies iOS default blue tint color to button text
- System-type buttons override custom text colors initially

**Fix:**
- Changed button type from `.system` to `.custom` (Line 530)
- Added initial color assignment in `createKeyButton()` (Lines 543-546)
- Custom buttons respect color assignments immediately

```swift
// Before:
let button = UIButton(type: .system)

// After:
let button = UIButton(type: .custom)  // Story 6.1: Changed from .system to .custom to avoid blue tint color

// Added initial colors:
let isDark = textDocumentProxy.keyboardAppearance == .dark
button.backgroundColor = isDark ? darkKeyBackground : lightKeyBackground
button.setTitleColor(isDark ? darkTextColor : lightTextColor, for: .normal)
```

### Issue 2: Padding/Alignment Issues When Switching Layouts
**Symptom:** When switching from letters → numbers → letters, keyboard layout has padding/alignment issues.

**Root Cause:**
- Cached layouts weren't being properly removed from their previous superview
- Constraints were accumulating when reusing cached layouts
- Layout wasn't being forced to update immediately after reattachment

**Fix:**
- Explicitly remove cached layout from superview before re-adding (Line 224)
- Reset `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` to ensure proper constraint behavior (Line 230)
- Added `layoutIfNeeded()` to force immediate layout calculation (Line 241)
- Removed appearance cache check in `updateAppearanceForLayout()` to ensure colors always update (Lines 649-650)

```swift
// Added explicit superview removal:
cachedLayout.removeFromSuperview()

// Reset constraint behavior:
cachedLayout.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

// Force immediate layout:
cachedLayout.layoutIfNeeded()
```

**2. createKeyboardLayout() - Lines 213-265**
- Moved cleanup to top of method
- Added explicit `removeFromSuperview()` for cached layouts
- Reset `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints`
- Added `layoutIfNeeded()` for immediate layout

**3. updateAppearanceForLayout() - Lines 645-662**

## Testing Verification

### Test Case 1: Initial Keyboard Display
- [ ] Open keyboard → Verify letters are gray on gray background (not blue)
- [ ] Test in light mode → Keys should be #F8F8F8 on #D9D9D9
- [ ] Test in dark mode → Keys should be #4A4A4A on #191919

### Test Case 2: Layout Switching (Letters → Numbers)
- [ ] Start in letter layout
- [ ] Tap "123" button
- [ ] Verify number layout displays correctly
- [ ] Verify no padding/alignment issues
- [ ] Verify colors are consistent

### Test Case 3: Layout Switching (Numbers → Symbols)
- [ ] From number layout, tap "#+="
- [ ] Verify symbol layout displays correctly
- [ ] Verify no padding/alignment issues
- [ ] Verify colors are consistent

### Test Case 4: Layout Switching (Symbols → Letters)
- [ ] From symbol layout, tap "ABC"
- [ ] Verify letter layout displays correctly (NOT blue text!)
- [ ] Verify no padding/alignment issues
- [ ] Verify colors are consistent

### Test Case 5: Rapid Layout Switching
- [ ] Rapidly switch: ABC → 123 → #+= → 123 → ABC
- [ ] Verify no layout drift or accumulating issues
- [ ] Verify colors remain consistent throughout

## Technical Details

### Why UIButton(type: .custom)?

**System Buttons (.system):**
- Default blue tint color for text
- Automatically applies system appearance
- Overrides custom colors initially
- Designed for standard iOS UI elements

**Custom Buttons (.custom):**
- No default tint color
- Respects color assignments immediately
- Full control over appearance
- Perfect for custom keyboards

### Why layoutIfNeeded()?

When reusing cached layouts, the Auto Layout engine may defer layout calculations until the next layout pass. This can cause temporary misalignment. `layoutIfNeeded()` forces the layout engine to calculate and apply constraints immediately, preventing visual glitches.

### Why Remove Appearance Cache Check?

The appearance cache optimization was preventing color updates when switching between cached layouts. Since layout switching is relatively infrequent (user action), the small performance cost of always updating colors is acceptable and ensures visual consistency.

## Performance Impact

**Expected:** Minimal
- Button type change: No impact
- Layout force update: <1ms per switch
- Color update on cached layouts: <5ms per switch

**Acceptable Trade-off:**
- Slightly reduced caching efficiency
- Guaranteed visual consistency
- Better user experience

---

## Rollback

If issues persist, can revert:

```swift
// Revert to .system buttons:
let button = UIButton(type: .system)
// Remove initial color assignment

// Revert appearance cache:
if cachedKeyboardAppearance == textDocumentProxy.keyboardAppearance {
    return
}
```

## Status

- ✅ Blue text issue: **FIXED**
- ✅ Layout alignment issue: **FIXED**
- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ Builds successfully
- ⏳ Awaiting user testing confirmation

---

## Next Steps

1. Build and test on physical device
2. Verify all layout switches work correctly
3. Verify colors are consistent across all layouts
4. Confirm no blue text appears anywhere
5. Confirm no alignment issues

**Expected Result:** Keyboard displays with consistent Apple-like gray colors across all layouts, with no blue text and no alignment issues when switching between layouts.
