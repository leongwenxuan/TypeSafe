# Story 2.2: Text Capture & Snippet Management

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** keyboard extension,  
**I want** to capture typed text in manageable snippets,  
**so that** I can send appropriate context to the backend for analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Text captured via `UITextDocumentProxy` as user types
2. Maintains sliding window of last 300 characters
3. Triggers analysis after significant typing (e.g., space, punctuation, or every 50 chars)
4. Avoids sending password field content (detect secure text entry)
5. Memory-efficient text buffer (no leak over time)
6. Unit tests verify snippet windowing logic

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.1 (Keyboard Extension Target & Basic Setup):**
- Keyboard extension target is set up and functional with basic QWERTY layout
- `KeyboardViewController` properly inherits from `UIInputViewController`
- App Group configured with `group.com.typesafe.shared` for data sharing
- `textDocumentProxy` API is available for text insertion and deletion
- Full Access (`RequestsOpenAccess: true`) configured for future network calls
- Testing recommendations: Extract snippet windowing logic into testable pure functions for unit testing

**Key Technical Decisions from Story 2.1:**
- Dev correctly identified that protocol-based design improves testability
- Future networking code should be mockable for unit tests
- Manual physical device testing required for realistic behavior validation

### Architecture Context

**[Source: docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md]**
- Keyboard Extension captures typed text via `UITextDocumentProxy` (ephemeral snippet windows)
- Must make HTTPS calls to backend when Full Access is granted
- Read/write minimal state via App Group

**[Source: docs/architecture/data-flows.md#5.1 Text Analysis]**
- Keyboard batches the last N chars (e.g., up to 300)
- POST /analyze-text with anonymized `session_id`
- Keyboard shows banner if `risk_level ∈ {medium, high}`

**Request Format for Future Story:**
```http
POST /analyze-text
{ "session_id":"anon-uuid", "app_bundle":"com.whatsapp", "text":"send me your OTP" }
```

**[Source: docs/architecture/key-constraints-assumptions.md]**
- Keyboard Extension sandbox: can read what the user types via our keyboard only
- Full Access required for network calls from the keyboard
- Privacy: no raw PII storage, anonymized session IDs, 7-day retention
- Latency target < 2s round trip for text analysis

**[Source: docs/architecture/security-privacy.md]**
- Send only small text snippets
- Keyboard respects secure text entry fields (no analysis for passwords)
- Anonymization: `session_id` = random UUID, no PII

### Data Models

**TextSnippet (Internal Model):**
```swift
struct TextSnippet {
    let content: String          // The actual text snippet (max 300 chars)
    let timestamp: Date          // When captured
    let shouldAnalyze: Bool      // Whether to send to backend
    let triggerReason: TriggerReason  // Why analysis was triggered
}

enum TriggerReason {
    case significantPause    // Space or punctuation detected
    case characterThreshold  // Every 50 characters
    case manualTrigger      // Explicit user action (future)
}
```

**Snippet Windowing Rules:**
- Maintain sliding window of last 300 characters
- Trim older characters when exceeding 300 chars (FIFO)
- Trigger analysis on:
  - Space character typed
  - Punctuation (., !, ?, ,) typed
  - Every 50 characters typed
- Do NOT trigger analysis if:
  - Secure text entry field detected
  - Text buffer is empty or < 10 characters

### Component Specifications

**TextSnippetManager (Pure Swift Class):**
```swift
class TextSnippetManager {
    private var buffer: String = ""
    private var charactersSinceLastTrigger: Int = 0
    private let maxBufferSize: Int = 300
    private let triggerThreshold: Int = 50
    
    func append(_ character: String) -> TextSnippet?
    func deleteLastCharacter() -> Bool
    func shouldTriggerAnalysis(_ character: String) -> Bool
    func getCurrentSnippet() -> String
    func clear()
}
```

**Key Methods:**
- `append()`: Add character to buffer, return snippet if trigger condition met
- `deleteLastCharacter()`: Handle backspace, return true if buffer modified
- `shouldTriggerAnalysis()`: Check if character triggers analysis (space/punctuation/threshold)
- `getCurrentSnippet()`: Get current buffer content (up to 300 chars)
- `clear()`: Reset buffer (e.g., when analysis sent or field changed)

**SecureTextDetector (Pure Swift Class):**
```swift
class SecureTextDetector {
    func isSecureField(_ proxy: UITextDocumentProxy) -> Bool
}
```

**Detection Strategy:**
- Check `proxy.keyboardType == .numberPad` (common for PINs)
- Check if `proxy.textContentType` contains password-related hints
- Use heuristics: no context text available from proxy (security limitation)

### Integration with KeyboardViewController

**Modify Existing KeyboardViewController:**
- Add properties:
  ```swift
  private let snippetManager = TextSnippetManager()
  private let secureDetector = SecureTextDetector()
  ```
- Update `textDidChange()` lifecycle method to detect field changes
- Modify key tap handlers to call `snippetManager.append()`
- Check for secure fields before processing snippets

**Integration Points:**
- When character is typed → `snippetManager.append()` → check for snippet trigger
- When backspace is tapped → `snippetManager.deleteLastCharacter()`
- When text field changes → `textDidChange()` → clear snippet buffer
- Before sending to backend (future Story 2.3) → check `secureDetector.isSecureField()`

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Standards [Source: docs/architecture/observability-testing.md]:**
- Synthetic tests with seeded prompts
- iOS UI tests for keyboard behavior

**Unit Testing Strategy for This Story:**
1. **Create Unit Test Target** (if not exists):
   - Add new "TypeSafeTests" unit test target to Xcode project
   - Link necessary frameworks (XCTest, Foundation)
   - Ensure test target has access to TypeSafeKeyboard classes

2. **Test Coverage Requirements:**
   - `TextSnippetManager`:
     - ✅ Test sliding window maintains 300 char limit
     - ✅ Test trigger on space character
     - ✅ Test trigger on punctuation (., !, ?, ,)
     - ✅ Test trigger every 50 characters
     - ✅ Test no trigger for secure fields
     - ✅ Test backspace handling
     - ✅ Test buffer clear operation
     - ✅ Test edge case: empty buffer
     - ✅ Test edge case: exactly 300 characters
     - ✅ Test edge case: rapid character input (300+ chars)
   
   - `SecureTextDetector`:
     - ✅ Test detection of `.numberPad` keyboard type
     - ✅ Test detection via `textContentType` hints
     - ✅ Test false positives (regular text fields)

3. **Test File Locations:**
   - `TypeSafeTests/TextSnippetManagerTests.swift`
   - `TypeSafeTests/SecureTextDetectorTests.swift`

4. **Test Framework:**
   - Use XCTest (iOS standard)
   - Follow Given-When-Then structure in test names:
     ```swift
     func test_append_whenSpaceTyped_triggersAnalysis()
     func test_append_whenBufferExceeds300Chars_maintainsWindowSize()
     ```

5. **Mocking Strategy:**
   - Mock `UITextDocumentProxy` for `SecureTextDetector` tests
   - No mocking needed for `TextSnippetManager` (pure logic)

### Memory Management

**Memory Safety Requirements:**
- String buffer must not grow unbounded
- Old characters must be trimmed when exceeding 300 chars
- No retain cycles between manager and view controller

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use value types (structs) for `TextSnippet`
- Ensure `buffer` string is properly trimmed in `append()`
- Use `weak` references if necessary (not expected for this story)

### Privacy Considerations

**Critical Privacy Rules:**
- NEVER capture or store text from secure text entry fields
- Always check `isSecureField()` before processing any text
- Snippet buffer must be ephemeral (cleared on field change)
- No persistent storage of raw text snippets (only send to backend for analysis)

### Technical Constraints

- iOS Keyboard Extension sandbox limitations apply
- Must work within < 30MB memory budget (per Epic 2.8 requirements)
- Cannot access system clipboard or other apps' data
- Limited to characters typed through our keyboard only

### Performance Targets

**For This Story (Preliminary):**
- Snippet append operation: < 1ms per character
- Trigger detection: < 1ms
- Buffer trimming: < 5ms for 300+ character operation

**Note:** Comprehensive performance profiling is scheduled for Story 2.8, but these targets ensure no obvious bottlenecks.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** ⭐

The implementation demonstrates strong software engineering practices:

- **Architecture:** Clean separation of concerns with pure logic classes (TextSnippetManager, SecureTextDetector) that are independently testable
- **Code Quality:** Well-structured, readable code with appropriate use of Swift idioms (Set for O(1) lookups, value types for data)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive inline comments explaining all non-trivial logic, clear method documentation
- **Memory Safety:** Proper buffer management with FIFO trimming, no retain cycles, bounded growth enforced
- **Test Coverage:** 40+ unit tests covering all major code paths and edge cases

**Key Strengths:**
1. TextSnippetManager uses efficient string operations (removeFirst for FIFO)
2. Secure field detection implements dual-layer approach (keyboardType + textContentType)
3. KeyboardViewController integration is minimal and focused (processCharacterForSnippet helper)
4. Tests follow Given-When-Then naming convention with clear assertions
5. Mock UITextDocumentProxy properly implemented for testability

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring needed - code quality is already high.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS - Swift best practices followed, clear naming, proper access control
- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS - Files in correct locations (TypeSafeKeyboard/, TypeSafeTests/)
- **Testing Strategy:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Tests written but target setup required for execution
- **All ACs Met:** ✅ PASS (in code) - All 6 acceptance criteria implemented, pending runtime verification

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by Dev:**
- [x] TextSnippetManager: Clean pure logic implementation with sliding window
- [x] SecureTextDetector: Dual-layer secure field detection
- [x] KeyboardViewController: Minimal integration with proper lifecycle handling
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests: 40+ tests covering all scenarios
- [x] Memory-safe implementation with bounded buffer
- [x] All code properly documented

**Required Before "Ready for Done":**
- [ ] **Configure unit test target in Xcode** (TEST-001) - 15 minutes
  - Follow TEST_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md
  - Add TypeSafeTests target via File → New → Target
  - Link TypeSafeKeyboard and enable testability
  - Run Cmd+U to verify all 40+ tests pass

- [ ] **Execute manual integration testing** (TEST-002) - 20 minutes
  - Complete Task 7 scenarios from STORY_2.2_MANUAL_STEPS.md
  - Verify snippet triggers in simulator console
  - Test secure field detection in Safari password fields
  - Confirm field switching clears buffer
  - Validate backspace handling

**Recommended Improvements:**
- [ ] Replace print() statements with os_log for production-ready logging (MNT-001)
  - Current debug logging is fine for MVP but not scalable
  - Consider structured logging framework before Story 2.3
  
- [ ] Perform memory profiling with Instruments (Task 8)
  - Use Xcode Instruments → Leaks
  - Type 1000+ characters to stress test
  - Verify no memory leaks and stable buffer size

- [ ] Monitor secure field detection effectiveness in production (REL-001)
  - Current implementation covers common patterns (.numberPad, password content types)
  - Some apps may use custom secure fields without proper hints
  - Add behavioral heuristics if false negatives occur

### Security Review

✅ **PASS** - Secure field detection properly implemented

**Strengths:**
- Dual-layer detection: keyboardType (.numberPad) + textContentType (.password, .newPassword, .oneTimeCode)
- Early return in processCharacterForSnippet prevents any snippet capture for secure fields
- Ephemeral buffer only (no persistent storage)
- Buffer cleared on field change via textDidChange()

**Considerations:**
- Potential false negatives for custom secure fields without proper iOS hints
- This is documented and acceptable for MVP - can enhance with heuristics if needed
- Architecture acknowledges iOS sandbox limitations [key-constraints-assumptions.md]

**Test Coverage:**
- 15+ tests for SecureTextDetector covering all detection paths
- Tests for false positive prevention (email, username, phone pad)
- Mock UITextDocumentProxy properly validates all scenarios

### Performance Considerations

✅ **PASS** - Efficient implementation meets preliminary targets

**Analysis:**
- Append operation: O(1) amortized, O(n) only when trimming (n = excess chars, bounded by 300)
- Trigger detection: O(1) with Set membership lookup
- Buffer retrieval: O(1) property access
- String trimming uses removeFirst(excessCount) - efficient for bounded excess

**Targets (code analysis):**
- Append character: < 1ms ✅ (O(1) amortized, should easily meet)
- Trigger detection: < 1ms ✅ (O(1) Set lookup, trivial)
- Buffer trimming: < 5ms ✅ (O(excessCount) bounded, should meet)

**Note:** Story 2.8 will perform comprehensive profiling. Current code structure shows no obvious bottlenecks.

**Trade-off Justified:**
- removeFirst(n) copies remaining chars (~300 worst case) vs circular buffer complexity
- Simplicity and testability outweigh marginal performance gain
- 300 char copy is negligible on modern iOS devices

### Files Modified During Review

None - no code changes needed. Implementation quality is excellent.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.2-text-capture-snippet-management.yml
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.2-nfr-20250118.md

**Quality Score: 85/100**
- Security: 25/25 (excellent)
- Performance: 22/25 (efficient code, no runtime verification)
- Reliability: 18/25 (solid code, zero runtime validation)
- Maintainability: 20/25 (excellent structure, minor logging improvements)

### Recommended Status

**Current Status:** Ready for Manual Testing

**Next Status After Verification:**
- ✅ **Ready for Done** - After completing:
  1. Unit test target setup (15 min)
  2. All 40+ tests passing (Cmd+U)
  3. Manual integration testing (20 min)
  4. Memory profiling recommended (10 min)

**Rationale:**
Implementation quality is **excellent** - code is clean, well-tested, properly documented, and architecturally sound. The CONCERNS gate is purely due to **lack of runtime verification**, not code quality issues. Once manual testing confirms behavior matches design, story can move to Done.

### Summary

**What's Excellent:**
- Clean architecture with testable pure logic classes
- Comprehensive test coverage (40+ tests)
- Efficient algorithms and memory management
- Proper secure field detection
- Well-documented code

**What's Needed:**
- Manual Xcode test target setup (cannot be automated)
- Runtime verification on simulator/device
- Confirmation that all tests pass

**Confidence Level:** HIGH for code quality, MEDIUM for runtime behavior (will become HIGH after verification)

**Time to Complete:** ~40 minutes of manual work (15 min test setup + 20 min integration testing + 5 min verification)
