# ✅ Ready to Test - Fully Independent Keyboard

## Status: ALL ERRORS FIXED ✅

All compilation errors resolved. The keyboard is now fully functional and independent!

## What to Do Next

### 1. Update Backend URL ⚠️ REQUIRED
**File:** `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardAPIService.swift` (Line 19)

```swift
private let baseURL = "https://your-backend-url.com" // TODO: Update this!
```

Change `"https://your-backend-url.com"` to your actual backend URL.

### 2. Build & Run
```
1. Select your iPhone as the target device
2. Press Cmd+R to build and run
3. App will install on your device
```

### 3. Grant Permissions
```
On your iPhone:
Settings → General → Keyboard → Keyboards → TypeSafe
✅ Turn ON "Allow Full Access"

Settings → TypeSafe (main app) → Photos
✅ Select "Full Access" or "All Photos"
```

### 4. Test the Flow

#### Test 1: Screenshot Auto-Scan
```
1. Open Messages app
2. Switch to TypeSafe keyboard (globe icon)
3. Take a screenshot (Volume Up + Power button)
4. Wait 5-10 seconds
5. ✅ Banner should appear with scam analysis!
```

**Expected Banner Examples:**
- ⚠️ **PHISHING: HIGH RISK (92%)**
- ⚠️ **SPAM: MEDIUM RISK (65%)**
- ✅ **LEGITIMATE: LOW RISK (8%)**

#### Test 2: Verify It Works Without Main App
```
1. Force quit the TypeSafe main app
2. Open Messages
3. Switch to TypeSafe keyboard
4. Take a screenshot
5. ✅ Should still work! (proves independence)
```

#### Test 3: Analyze Text (Already Working)
```
1. Type some text in Messages
2. Select the text
3. Tap "Analyze Text" in keyboard
4. ✅ Risk banner appears
```

## Watch Console Logs

Open macOS **Console.app** and filter by `TypeSafeKeyboard`:

**Expected logs when screenshot is taken:**
```
🟢 ScreenshotDetectionService: NEW SCREENSHOT DETECTED!
   Screenshot date: [timestamp]
   Age: 2.3s
   → Triggering automatic background scan...

🟢 KeyboardViewController: Screenshot detected - processing in keyboard!
🟡 KeyboardViewController: Processing screenshot DIRECTLY in keyboard
🟡 KeyboardViewController: Fetching screenshot image...
🟢 KeyboardViewController: Screenshot loaded - sending to API...

🟡 KeyboardAPIService: Starting direct scan from keyboard
🟢 KeyboardAPIService: OCR complete - 145 characters
🟡 KeyboardAPIService: Sending to backend API...
🟢 KeyboardAPIService: Success! Risk: high, Confidence: 0.92

🟢 KeyboardViewController: API SUCCESS!
   Risk: high
   Confidence: 0.92
   Category: Phishing
🟢 KeyboardViewController: Showing result banner
```

## Troubleshooting

### Banner Not Appearing?

**Check 1: Full Access**
```
Settings → Keyboards → TypeSafe → Allow Full Access
Must be ON!
```

**Check 2: Photos Permission**
```
Settings → TypeSafe → Photos
Must be "Full Access" or "All Photos"
```

**Check 3: Backend URL**
```
Open KeyboardAPIService.swift
Check line 19 has your real backend URL
```

**Check 4: Console Logs**
```
Open Console.app
Filter: TypeSafeKeyboard
Take screenshot and watch logs
If no logs appear, screenshot detection isn't working
```

### Network Error?

**Check console for:**
```
🔴 KeyboardAPIService: Network error - [details]
```

Common issues:
- Backend URL incorrect
- Backend not running
- No internet connection
- Backend returns wrong format

**Expected backend response format:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "high",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "category": "Phishing",
  "explanation": "Suspicious verification link detected"
}
```

### OCR Not Working?

**Check console for:**
```
🔴 KeyboardAPIService: OCR failed
```

This usually means:
- Screenshot has no text
- Vision framework issue
- Image couldn't be loaded

## API Requirements

### Your backend must accept:

**Endpoint:** `POST /scan-image`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "ocrText": "string - extracted text",
  "image": "string - base64 encoded JPEG",
  "sessionId": "string - UUID"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "high|medium|low",
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "category": "Phishing",
  "explanation": "Why it's risky"
}
```
