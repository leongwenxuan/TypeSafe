nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - API key security: Loaded from environment, never logged
      - Input validation: Image format and size validated
      - Data minimization: Only metadata logged, not image content
      - Error sanitization: No sensitive data in error messages
      - Safety settings intentionally permissive (required for scam content analysis)
  
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Timeout: 1.5s configured (within 3.5s endpoint budget)
      - Image size limit: 4MB enforced
      - Lazy initialization: Model loaded on first use
      - No caching: Correct decision for large image data
      - Async implementation: Proper use of asyncio.to_thread
  
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Comprehensive error handling: Rate limits, auth, server errors, timeouts
      - Graceful fallback: Returns "unknown" risk on failures
      - Response validation: All fields normalized and validated
      - Edge cases covered: Empty images, oversized, invalid formats
  
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Test coverage: 100% exceeds target
      - Code structure: Clean separation of concerns
      - Documentation: Comprehensive docstrings
      - Consistency: Follows OpenAI service patterns
      - Type hints: Proper typing throughout
      - Note: imghdr deprecation warning (Python 3.13) - low priority future task

assessment_summary: |
  Story 1.4 demonstrates exemplary software engineering with:
  
  **Code Quality (Exceptional):**
  - 100% test coverage (85/85 statements, 31 tests)
  - Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases
  - Proper async/await patterns
  - Clean architecture with separation of concerns
  - Consistent with established patterns from Story 1.3
  
  **Security (Pass):**
  - API key security maintained
  - Input validation prevents attacks
  - Logging sanitized (no sensitive data)
  - Safety settings appropriate for use case
  
  **Performance (Pass):**
  - 1.5s timeout meets budget
  - Image size limits enforced
  - Efficient async implementation
  - Appropriate decision on no caching
  
  **Test Quality (Exceptional):**
  - All 31 tests pass
  - Comprehensive coverage of success, error, and edge cases
  - Proper mocking prevents real API calls
  - Clear test organization and naming
  
  **Compliance:**
  - All 6 acceptance criteria fully met
  - All tasks completed as specified
  - Follows coding standards and project structure
  - Requirements traceability: 100%
  
  **Recommendations:**
  - 4 minor recommendations for future consideration
  - None are blocking or urgent
  - All are informational or nice-to-have improvements
  
  **Overall Assessment:**
  This is production-ready code that can be confidently integrated into Story 1.7
  (scan-image endpoint) without concerns. The implementation demonstrates deep
  understanding of requirements, excellent engineering practices, and thorough
  attention to quality and security.

next_steps: |
  1. Mark story as Done
  2. Story 1.4 Gemini service is ready for integration
  3. Proceed with Story 1.5 (Risk Aggregation) to combine OpenAI and Gemini outputs
  4. Consider addressing imghdr deprecation in future Python upgrade story
