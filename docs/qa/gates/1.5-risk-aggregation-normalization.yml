final_assessment: |
  Story 1.5 demonstrates exemplary software engineering practices:
  
  ✅ All 6 acceptance criteria fully met
  ✅ 93% test coverage (exceeds 80% target)
  ✅ All NFRs passed (security, performance, reliability, maintainability)
  ✅ Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
  ✅ Clean architecture with excellent separation of concerns
  ✅ Production-ready code with minimal risk
  
  The risk aggregator provides a robust, maintainable interface for combining
  multiple AI provider outputs. Ready for integration in Stories 1.6 and 1.7.
  
  No blocking issues. No concerns. Recommended for Done status.
