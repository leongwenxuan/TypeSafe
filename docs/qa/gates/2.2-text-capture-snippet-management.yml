top_issues:
  - id: 'TEST-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Unit test target not configured in Xcode - tests cannot run without manual setup'
    suggested_action: 'Follow TEST_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md to add test target via Xcode IDE (10-15 min)'
  - id: 'TEST-002'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'No manual integration testing performed on simulator - real device behavior unverified'
    suggested_action: 'Complete Task 7 test scenarios on iOS simulator with debug console monitoring'
  - id: 'REL-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'SecureTextDetector may have false negatives for some secure field types not covered by .numberPad or textContentType hints'
    suggested_action: 'Monitor in production; consider adding heuristics for context-less fields if issues arise'
  - id: 'MNT-001'
    severity: low
    finding: 'Debug print statements in KeyboardViewController should use proper logging framework'
    suggested_action: 'Consider replacing print() with os_log or custom logger for production readiness'

waiver:
  active: false

nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Secure field detection properly implemented with dual checks (keyboardType + textContentType). Password content skipped correctly.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'String operations efficient with removeFirst() for FIFO trimming. O(1) trigger checks. Preliminary targets met (<1ms per char).'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code looks solid but no runtime validation yet. Field change detection uses textDidChange() correctly. Needs manual testing confirmation.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code organization, clear separation of concerns, comprehensive inline documentation, testable pure logic classes.'

code_review_highlights:
  strengths:
    - 'TextSnippetManager: Clean pure logic, perfect for unit testing, well-documented'
    - 'Sliding window implementation efficient with removeFirst() for FIFO trimming'
    - 'Comprehensive test coverage: 25 tests for TextSnippetManager, 15+ for SecureTextDetector'
    - 'Mock UITextDocumentProxy implementation in tests is properly done'
    - 'KeyboardViewController integration is minimal and focused (processCharacterForSnippet helper)'
    - 'All acceptance criteria implemented in code'
    - 'Memory safety: no retain cycles, value types used appropriately'
  improvements:
    - 'Test target configuration must be completed for verification'
    - 'Manual device testing required to validate real-world behavior'
    - 'Debug logging should use proper framework for production'
    - 'SecureTextDetector could benefit from behavioral validation on various app password fields'
