The following files were created but need to be manually added to the Xcode project:

**Add to TypeSafe Target:**
```
TypeSafe/Models/AppSettings.swift

TypeSafe/Utils/SafariView.swift
TypeSafe/Views/Settings/FullAccessSection.swift
TypeSafe/Views/Settings/PrivacySection.swift
TypeSafe/Views/Settings/VoiceAlertsSection.swift
TypeSafe/Views/Settings/DataManagementSection.swift
TypeSafe/Views/Settings/PrivacyPolicySection.swift
```

**Add to TypeSafeTests Target:**
```
TypeSafeTests/SettingsManagerTests.swift
TypeSafeTests/SettingsViewTests.swift
TypeSafeTests/DataDeletionTests.swift
```

**Steps to Add:**
1. Open Xcode
2. Right-click on appropriate group (Models/Services/Views/Tests)
3. Select "Add Files to TypeSafe..."
4. Navigate to the file location
5. Ensure "TypeSafe" target is checked
6. Click "Add"

### 2. Build and Run

After adding files to Xcode:
```bash
# Clean build folder
Product > Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)

# Build project
Product > Build (Cmd+B)

# Run tests
Product > Test (Cmd+U)

# Run app
Product > Run (Cmd+R)
```

### 3. Test Settings Functionality

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Navigate to Settings tab
- [ ] Verify all sections display correctly
- [ ] Toggle "Send Screenshot Images" (should default to OFF)
- [ ] Toggle "Scan Result Notifications"
- [ ] Tap "Settings" button for Full Access ‚Üí iOS Settings should open
- [ ] Tap "Delete All Data" ‚Üí Confirmation dialog should appear
- [ ] Confirm deletion ‚Üí All data should be cleared, new session created
- [ ] Tap "Privacy Policy" ‚Üí Safari view should open
- [ ] Verify app version displays correctly
- [ ] Test dark mode appearance
- [ ] Verify VoiceOver accessibility

## üîß Integration Changes

### Modified Files

1. **TypeSafe/Views/SettingsView.swift**
   - Complete redesign using Form-based layout
   - Integrated all new settings sections
   - Added onAppear settings sync

2. **TypeSafe/Services/APIService.swift**
   - Replaced `PrivacyManager` with `SettingsManager`
   - Updated to read screenshot setting from `SettingsManager.shared`

3. **TypeSafeKeyboard/SharedStorageManager.swift**
   - Added settings sync methods:
     - `getSendScreenshotImagesSetting()`
     - `getVoiceAlertsEnabledSetting()`
     - `getScanResultNotificationsSetting()`
     - `getLastSettingsSync()`

## üé® Key Features

### Privacy-First Design
- Screenshot upload defaults to OFF
- Clear visual indicators (green for private, orange for shared)
- Transparent privacy explanations for all settings

### iOS Settings Deep Linking
- Button opens iOS Settings app
- Step-by-step guidance overlay
- Clear instructions for enabling Full Access

### Comprehensive Data Deletion
- Clears UserDefaults (main app)
- Clears App Group storage (keyboard sync)
- Placeholder for Core Data cleanup (Story 3.6)
- Generates new anonymous session ID
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion

### App Group Synchronization
- Bi-directional sync between app and keyboard
- Keyboard-relevant settings only (no sensitive data)
- Timestamp tracking for sync validation

---

## üìù Technical Decisions

1. **Singleton Pattern for SettingsManager**
   - Ensures app-wide consistency
   - Efficient UserDefaults access
   - Easy dependency injection for testing

2. **Modular Section Components**
   - Each settings section is a separate SwiftUI view
   - Improves maintainability and testability
   - Enables independent updates

3. **Privacy-First Defaults**
   - All data-sharing features default to OFF
   - User must explicitly opt-in
   - Clear explanations for privacy implications

4. **Form-Based UI**
   - Native iOS Settings appearance
   - Follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines
   - Consistent with user expectations

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Before Production Release

1. **Update Privacy Policy URL**
   - Replace placeholder URL in `PrivacyPolicySection.swift`
   - Production URL: `https://typesafe.app/privacy`
   - Terms URL: `https://typesafe.app/terms`

2. **Test on Physical Device**
   - Verify iOS Settings deep linking works
   - Test App Group synchronization with keyboard
   - Verify data deletion completeness

3. **Update Info.plist**
   - Add privacy descriptions if needed
   - Verify URL schemes if required

4. **Run Full Regression Suite**
   - All existing tests should still pass
   - New tests add 50+ test cases
   - Verify no breaking changes

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Voice Alerts Implementation**
   - UI is prepared, toggle is disabled
   - Marked as "COMING SOON"
   - Can be enabled in future update

2. **Core Data Integration**
   - Data deletion has placeholder for Core Data cleanup
   - Will be completed with Story 3.6 (Scan History)

2. **Core Data Cleanup:** Placeholder in deletion code (pending Story 3.6)
3. **Privacy Policy URL:** Using placeholder (needs production URL)
4. **Xcode Integration:** Files not auto-added to project targets
