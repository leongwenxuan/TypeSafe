# üß≠ TypeSafe ‚Äî Product Management Summary

### üèÅ Mission
> Build a proactive, privacy-first iOS keyboard extension that protects users from scams before they happen ‚Äî through intelligent detection, clear guidance, and trust-driven design.

---

## üß± Product Vision
TypeSafe is an **AI-powered typing layer** that detects, explains, and prevents risky or scam-related communication ‚Äî whether typed, pasted, or screenshotted.

It acts as a **safety shield** between users and potential scams, using:
- Real-time natural language detection
- Visual screenshot scanning
- Multi-model reasoning orchestration via the ILM (Intelligent Logic & Mediation) Layer

## üéØ Strategic Objectives

| Objective | Description | KPI |
|------------|--------------|-----|
| **1. Prevent Scam Sharing** | Detect and flag risky or fraudulent content typed or copied into apps | ‚â• 90% detection accuracy |
| **2. Build User Trust** | Deliver explanations that educate without alarming | ‚â• 80% users rate alerts as ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù |
| **3. Preserve Privacy** | Analyze locally or with explicit consent | 100% App Store compliance |
| **4. Enable Extensibility** | ILM layer allows easy addition of new detection APIs/tools | < 1 day integration cycle |
