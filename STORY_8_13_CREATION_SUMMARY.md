## Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Fake Courier Company
```
Scam: "FedEx Express SG - Package awaiting delivery"
Detection: Not registered in Singapore, missing "Pte Ltd" suffix
Similar to: FedEx (legitimate company)
Verdict: HIGH RISK - Fake company impersonating FedEx
```

### Use Case 2: Tech Support Scam
```
Scam: "Microsoft Security Department - Your PC is infected"
Detection: Suspicious keyword "department", not a registered entity
Similar to: Microsoft (legitimate company)
Verdict: HIGH RISK - Microsoft doesn't operate as separate departments
```

### Use Case 3: Government Impersonation
```
Scam: "Singapore Customs Recovery Unit - Pay duty fees"
Detection: Suspicious keywords, generic name, not registered
Verdict: HIGH RISK - Government agencies are not private companies
```

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Entity Extraction (Story 8.2)
Add company name patterns:
```python
COMPANY_PATTERNS = [
    r'\b([A-Z][a-zA-Z]+(?: [A-Z][a-zA-Z]+)*) (?:Pte Ltd|Inc|Corp|Limited|LLC)\b',
    r'\b([A-Z][a-zA-Z]+(?: [A-Z][a-zA-Z]+)*) (?:Department|Division|Unit)\b',
]
```

### 2. MCP Agent Orchestration (Story 8.7)
Add company verification to agent workflow:
```python
async def _check_company(self, company: str, country: str):
    # Run company verification + scam database check
    evidence = await asyncio.gather(
        self.company_tool.verify_company(company, country),
        self.scam_db_tool.check_entity(company, "company")
    )
    return evidence
```

### 3. Scam Database (Story 8.3)
Store fake company names for future lookups:
- Entity type: "company"
- Store with country code
- Track report counts

## Comparison with Other Tools

| Tool | Entity Type | Speed | API Required | Caching | Cost |
|------|-------------|-------|--------------|---------|------|
| **Scam Database** | All | < 10ms | No | N/A | Free |
| **Phone Validator** | Phone | < 10ms | No | No | Free |
| **Domain Reputation** | URL | < 5s | Optional | 7 days | Low |
| **Company Verification** | Company | < 8s | Optional | 30 days | $2-5/1K |
| **Exa Search** | All | < 3s | Yes | 24 hours | $10-20/1K |

**Company Verification positioning:**
- **Longer cache** (30 days vs 7 days) - companies change less frequently
- **Higher cost** than domain checks - registry APIs are paid
- **Optional APIs** - works without keys but with limited verification
- **Country-specific** - adapts checks based on user location

## Business Impact

### Problem Addressed
**Business Impersonation Scams** are a significant threat:
- Fake courier companies (DHL, FedEx scams)
- Tech company impersonation (Apple, Microsoft)
- Government entity fraud
- Financial services fraud

**Current Gap:** TypeSafe can detect suspicious URLs and phone numbers but cannot verify if a claimed company is legitimate.

### Solution Provided
Company Verification Tool enables:
1. **Instant verification** of company registration
2. **Pattern-based detection** of fake companies
3. **Typo-squatting identification** (Microssoft vs Microsoft)
4. **Multi-country support** (adapts to user location)
5. **Evidence-based verdicts** with clear reasoning

### Expected Outcomes
- **Reduce false negatives** by 20-30% (catch more scams)
- **Improve user confidence** with registry-backed verification
- **Expand scam coverage** to business impersonation category
- **Enhance agent reasoning** with company legitimacy data

## Integration with Existing System

### Current MCP Agent Flow
```
Screenshot → OCR → Entity Extraction → Tool Routing → Verdict
                    ↓
              Entities: phone, url, email
                    ↓
              Tools: scam_db, domain_reputation, phone_validator
```

### Enhanced Flow with Story 8.13
```
Screenshot → OCR → Entity Extraction → Tool Routing → Verdict
                    ↓
              Entities: phone, url, email, company ← NEW
                    ↓
              Tools: scam_db, domain_reputation, phone_validator, 
                     company_verification ← NEW
```

### Tool Routing Logic
```python
# In MCP Agent
if entity_type == "company":
    # Run company verification + scam DB
    evidence = await self._check_company(entity_value, user_country)
```
