# Story 2.8: Privacy & Full Access Handling

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** keyboard user,  
**I want** clear prompts about Full Access and privacy,  
**so that** I understand what permissions are needed and why.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Keyboard detects if Full Access is disabled
2. Displays in-keyboard message: "Enable Full Access to detect scams in real-time"
3. Link to Settings provided (if possible via keyboard UI)
4. When Full Access is disabled, keyboard functions as basic keyboard (no API calls)
5. Privacy message explains: "TypeSafe only analyzes text for scam detection, not stored"
6. Keyboard respects secure text entry fields (no analysis for passwords)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement Full Access Detection (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Add `hasFullAccess` property check in `KeyboardViewController`
  - [x] Detect Full Access status using `UIPasteboard` or network capability test

- [x] Task 4: Secure Text Entry Detection (AC: 6)
  - [x] Enhance `SecureTextDetector.swift` to check `textDocumentProxy.keyboardType`
  - [x] Detect password fields via `UITextContentType` and secure entry flags

  - [x] Maintain full keyboard functionality (typing, layouts, etc.)

- [x] Task 6: Add Unit Tests
  - [x] Test Full Access detection logic
  - [x] Test privacy message display conditions
  - [x] Test secure text entry detection
  - [x] Test graceful degradation behavior
  - [x] Mock Full Access states for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.7 (App Group Shared State):**
- Keyboard extension architecture is well-established with `KeyboardViewController.swift`
- UI components follow consistent patterns in `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/` directory
- Testing patterns established in `TypeSafeTests/` directory
- `SharedStorageManager.swift` provides example of privacy-safe data handling
- Source: Previous story implementation files

**From Story 2.4 (Inline Risk Alert Banners):**
- `RiskAlertBannerView.swift` provides UI pattern for in-keyboard messaging
- Banner positioning and styling patterns established
- Color coding and visual hierarchy already defined
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/RiskAlertBannerView.swift`

**From Story 2.3 (Backend API Integration):**
- `APIService.swift` handles all network calls to backend
- Network capability detection patterns available
- Session management with anonymous UUID already implemented
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/Networking/APIService.swift`

### Component Specifications

**Full Access Detection:**
- iOS keyboard extensions require Full Access for network calls [Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]
- Detection method: Test network capability or UIPasteboard access
- Store status in `KeyboardViewController` instance variable for performance
- **CRITICAL**: No API calls when Full Access disabled [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

**Privacy Messaging:**
- Clear explanation: "TypeSafe only analyzes text for scam detection, not stored" [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Minimization principle: send only small text snippets [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Anonymization: session_id = random UUID, no PII [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

**Secure Text Entry Detection:**
- Respect secure text entry fields (no analysis for passwords) [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Use `UITextDocumentProxy` properties to detect secure fields
- Enhanced `SecureTextDetector.swift` for comprehensive detection
- **CRITICAL**: Skip all text analysis for password fields

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Keyboard functions as basic keyboard when Full Access disabled [Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]
- Maintain typing functionality, layouts, and basic features
- Disable only network-dependent features (API calls, risk analysis)

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/PrivacyMessageView.swift` - Privacy message UI component
- `TypeSafeTests/PrivacyMessageViewTests.swift` - Unit tests for privacy message
- `TypeSafeTests/FullAccessDetectionTests.swift` - Unit tests for Full Access detection

**Files to Modify:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Add Full Access detection and privacy UI
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/SecureTextDetector.swift` - Enhanced secure text entry detection
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/Networking/APIService.swift` - Add Full Access checks before network calls
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/TextSnippetManager.swift` - Disable capture when Full Access disabled

### Technical Constraints

**iOS Keyboard Extension Limitations:**
- Network access requires Full Access permission
- Limited UI space within keyboard bounds
- Deep linking to Settings may not work in all iOS versions
- UIPasteboard access restricted without Full Access

**Privacy Requirements:**
- No PII storage or transmission [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Minimal data collection principle [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Clear user consent and explanation required
- Secure text entry fields must be completely excluded

**Performance Considerations:**
- Full Access detection should be cached (not checked on every keystroke)
- Privacy message should not impact keyboard responsiveness
- Graceful degradation should maintain typing performance

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `TypeSafeTests/` directory
- Follow existing test patterns from `SecureTextDetectorTests.swift`
- Test Full Access detection with mocked states
- Test privacy message display logic
- Test secure text entry detection accuracy
- Test graceful degradation behavior

**Integration Testing:**
- Verify Full Access detection on physical device
- Test Settings deep linking functionality
- Validate privacy message display in various scenarios
- Confirm secure text entry exclusion works correctly

**Privacy Testing:**
- Verify no API calls made when Full Access disabled
- Confirm secure text fields are properly excluded
- Test data minimization compliance
- Validate privacy message accuracy
