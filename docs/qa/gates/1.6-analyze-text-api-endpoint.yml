  notes: |
    Implementation fully complies with architecture specifications:
    - Follows defined API contract
    - Implements specified data flow (validate → analyze → store → respond)
    - Meets security requirements (validation, sanitization, privacy)
    - Uses established integration patterns (risk_aggregator, db.operations)
    - Follows error handling standards

  rollback_plan: |
    Simple rollback via version deployment:
    1. Previous version had no /analyze-text endpoint
    2. Clients should handle 404 gracefully (future keyboard implementation)
    3. No database schema changes (text_analyses table from Story 1.2)
    4. No breaking changes to existing endpoints

final_assessment: |
  Story 1.6 is production-ready with excellent implementation quality.
  
  Highlights:
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied
  - 28 comprehensive tests with 85% coverage
  - Robust error handling and privacy controls
  - Performance requirements met with buffer
  - No security issues identified
  - Clean, maintainable code
  
  The only identified risk (OPS-001: monitoring) is operational and non-blocking.
  Basic monitoring can be set up during deployment, with enhanced observability
  added iteratively post-launch.
  
  Recommendation: APPROVE for production deployment.
