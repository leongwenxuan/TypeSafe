# Quality Gate: Story 1.2 - Supabase Database Setup
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "1.2"
story_title: "Supabase Database Setup & Schema"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage. Database layer implementation demonstrates excellent engineering practices with proper schema design, thorough integration tests, and complete documentation. Manual cron job scheduling is appropriately documented."

# NFR Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Service role key usage properly documented. RLS disabled per architecture decision. Environment variables for credentials. No client exposure of database access."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper indexes on session_id and created_at. Connection pooling via Supabase client. Efficient query patterns in get_latest_result."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity. Check constraints validate risk_level. Comprehensive error handling prevents silent failures."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-documented code with comprehensive docstrings. Clean module structure. Migration-based schema management. Type hints throughout."

# Test Coverage Analysis
