# Story 2.6: "Explain Why" Popover Detail

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** keyboard user,  
**I want** to tap the alert banner to see why text was flagged,  
**so that** I understand the specific scam pattern detected.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tapping alert banner opens detail popover/card
2. Popover displays:
   - Risk level (Medium/High)
   - Category (e.g., "OTP Phishing", "Payment Scam")
   - AI-generated explanation (one-liner from backend)
3. Popover has "Got It" dismiss button
4. Popover dismisses on tapping outside or explicit close
5. Accessible via VoiceOver (explanation read aloud)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.4 (Inline Risk Alert Banners):**
- `RiskAlertBannerView` already implemented with tap gesture capability
- Banner displays for `medium` and `high` risk levels with color coding (amber/red)
- Banner receives `AnalyzeTextResponse` data including `category` and `explanation` fields
- Current banner implementation in `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/RiskAlertBannerView.swift`
- **IMPORTANT**: Banner should be positioned ABOVE the keyboard, not overlaying keyboard keys
- Banner currently occupies top 60pt but needs repositioning to extend keyboard height
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` [Lines 635-638]

**From Story 2.3 (Backend API Integration):**
- `AnalyzeTextResponse` model contains all required data for popover:
  - `risk_level: "medium" | "high"`
  - `category: String` (e.g., "otp_phishing", "payment_scam", "impersonation")
  - `explanation: String` (human-friendly one-liner from AI)
  - `confidence: Double`
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/Models/AnalyzeTextModels.swift`

**Technical Debt Context:**
- Story 2.4 implemented banner tap gesture but currently only dismisses banner
- **CRITICAL**: Banner positioning needs correction - should be above keyboard, not overlaying keys
- This story extends tap functionality AND fixes banner positioning
- Must maintain existing dismiss behavior as fallback option

### Component Specifications

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]

**Keyboard Extension Responsibilities:**
- Display inline **risk banners** and **explain** popover
- Make **HTTPS** calls to backend (when Full Access granted)
- Read/write minimal state via **App Group**

### Data Model Context

[Source: architecture/public-api-backend.md#6.1]

**AnalyzeTextResponse Schema:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "category": "otp_phishing|payment_scam|impersonation|unknown", 
  "explanation": "human-friendly one-liner",
  "ts": "2025-10-18T02:30:00Z"
}
```

**Category Display Mapping:**
- `otp_phishing` → "OTP Phishing"
- `payment_scam` → "Payment Scam" 
- `impersonation` → "Impersonation"
- `unknown` → "Suspicious Content"

### UI/UX Specifications

**Banner Positioning Requirements:**
- Banner must be positioned ABOVE the keyboard, not overlaying keys
- Keyboard extension height should increase to accommodate banner (224pt + 60pt = 284pt total)
- Banner area separate from keyboard input area
- No interference with key tapping or typing functionality

**Popover Design Requirements:**
- Modal presentation style over entire keyboard extension view
- Maximum width: 280pt (fits iPhone keyboard width)
- Rounded corners (12pt radius) matching iOS design language
- Drop shadow for depth perception
- Background: Semi-transparent overlay (0.4 alpha black)

**Content Layout:**
- Header: Risk level with appropriate color (amber/red matching banner)
- Category: Bold text showing scam type
- Explanation: Regular text, multi-line support
- Dismiss button: "Got It" with primary action styling

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- VoiceOver support for all text elements
- Semantic content traits for risk level announcement
- Dismiss gesture accessible via VoiceOver actions
- Focus management when popover appears/dismisses

### File Locations

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md + Project Structure]

**New Files to Create:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/ExplainWhyPopoverView.swift` - Popover UI component
- `TypeSafeTests/ExplainWhyPopoverViewTests.swift` - Unit tests

**Files to Modify:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/RiskAlertBannerView.swift` - Update tap gesture to show popover
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Add popover presentation logic
- `TypeSafeTests/RiskAlertBannerViewTests.swift` - Update tests for new tap behavior

### Technical Constraints

**iOS Keyboard Extension Limitations:**
- Cannot use `UIAlertController` (not available in keyboard extensions)
- Must use custom modal presentation within keyboard bounds
- Limited to keyboard extension's view hierarchy
- Memory constraints require efficient view lifecycle management

**Performance Requirements:**
- Popover must appear within 200ms of banner tap
- Smooth animation (0.3s duration) for show/dismiss
- No impact on typing performance while displayed
- Efficient memory usage (release when dismissed)

### Integration Approach

**Banner Tap Enhancement:**
1. Modify `RiskAlertBannerView` tap gesture to differentiate between:
   - Single tap → Show popover (new behavior)
   - Dismiss button tap → Dismiss banner (existing behavior)
2. Pass `AnalyzeTextResponse` data to popover for display
3. Maintain existing auto-dismiss timer behavior

**Popover Lifecycle:**
1. Banner tap triggers popover creation with response data
2. Popover presents modally over keyboard view
3. User interaction (button tap or outside tap) dismisses popover
4. Popover dismissal does NOT dismiss the underlying banner
5. Banner continues normal lifecycle (auto-dismiss after 10s total)
