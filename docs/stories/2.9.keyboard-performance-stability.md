## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.8 (Privacy & Full Access Handling):**
- Keyboard extension architecture is mature with established patterns
- Performance considerations already identified: Full Access detection cached for efficiency
- UI components follow consistent patterns that should be optimized together
- Testing infrastructure in place for comprehensive validation
- Source: Previous story implementation and completion notes

**From Story 2.3 (Backend API Integration):**
- `APIService.swift` handles all network calls with timeout settings
- Network operations should be async to prevent UI blocking
- Session management with UUID generation could impact performance
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/Networking/APIService.swift`

**From Story 2.2 (Text Capture & Snippet Management):**
- `TextSnippetManager.swift` maintains sliding window of 300 characters
- Text buffer management is critical for memory efficiency
- Trigger analysis logic could be performance bottleneck
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/TextSnippetManager.swift`

### Performance Requirements

**Architecture Performance Targets:**
- Backend API response: < 2s p95 for `/analyze-text` [Source: architecture/performance-capacity.md]
- Keyboard input latency: < 100ms (key press to character insertion) [Source: epic-2-keyboard-extension.md]
- Memory footprint: < 30MB during normal operation [Source: epic-2-keyboard-extension.md]
- Network timeout: 2.5s for API calls [Source: epic-2-keyboard-extension.md]

**iOS Keyboard Extension Constraints:**
- Limited memory allocation compared to main apps
- Restricted background processing capabilities
- Network access requires Full Access permission
- UI rendering must be efficient within keyboard bounds
- Source: architecture/key-constraints-assumptions.md

### Component Performance Considerations

**KeyboardViewController Optimization:**
- Main entry point for all user interactions
- Key press handling must be < 100ms latency
- View lifecycle management critical for memory efficiency
- Layout switching should be cached and optimized

**TextSnippetManager Performance:**
- Sliding window buffer (300 chars) must be memory efficient
- Text analysis triggers should not block UI thread
- Buffer cleanup and memory management critical
- Avoid string copying and excessive allocations

**APIService Network Performance:**
- All network calls must be asynchronous (background queue)
- Timeout handling: 2.5s for keyboard API calls
- Circuit breaker for repeated failures
- Error handling should not impact keyboard responsiveness

**UI Component Performance:**
- `RiskAlertBannerView` rendering should be optimized
- `PrivacyMessageView` should load efficiently
- View hierarchy should be minimal and cached
- Auto Layout constraints should be performance-optimized

### File Locations

**Files to Profile and Optimize:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Main performance bottleneck
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/TextSnippetManager.swift` - Memory management critical
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/Networking/APIService.swift` - Network performance
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/RiskAlertBannerView.swift` - UI rendering optimization
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/PrivacyMessageView.swift` - UI performance

### Technical Constraints

**iOS Performance Limitations:**
- Keyboard extensions have stricter memory limits than main apps
- Background processing is limited and may be terminated
- Network operations must complete quickly or be cancelled
- UI updates must happen on main thread for responsiveness

**Measurement and Testing:**
- Instruments profiling required for accurate performance measurement
- Physical device testing necessary (simulator performance not representative)
- Extended session testing needed to catch memory leaks
- Network condition simulation for timeout and failure scenarios

**Optimization Priorities:**
1. Input latency (most critical for user experience)
2. Memory management (prevents crashes and termination)
3. Network performance (affects real-time scam detection)
4. UI rendering (impacts perceived responsiveness)

### Testing Requirements

**Performance Testing Standards:**
- Use Instruments Time Profiler for latency measurement
- Use Instruments Allocations and Leaks for memory validation
- Test on physical devices (iPhone 12 minimum for worst-case)
- Extended typing sessions (1000+ characters) for stability
- Network condition simulation (slow, timeout, failure scenarios)

**Acceptance Testing:**
- Input latency < 100ms validated with Instruments
- Memory footprint < 30MB during normal operation
- No memory leaks over extended sessions
- No UI blocking during network operations
- Graceful degradation when backend unreachable
- No crashes during extended typing sessions

**Regression Testing:**
