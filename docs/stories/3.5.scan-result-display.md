# Story 3.5: Scan Result Display

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to see clear, understandable scan results,  
**so that** I know if the screenshot contains a potential scam.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Result view displays after scan completes
2. Shows risk level with color coding (Green: Low, Amber: Medium, Red: High)
3. Displays confidence percentage (e.g., "93% confident")
4. Shows scam category (e.g., "OTP Phishing", "Payment Scam")
5. Displays AI explanation in plain, empathetic language
6. Includes timestamp of scan
7. "Scan Another" button to return to main scan screen
8. Option to save result to history

  - [x] Test confidence percentage formatting
  - [x] Test timestamp formatting
  - [x] Test navigation actions
  - [x] Test save to history functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.4 completion notes:
- **Result Display**: ScanResultView was created with basic risk-based color coding and user actions
- **API Integration**: OCRTextPreviewView already navigates to ScanResultView after API response
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages already implemented

### API Response Structure
[Source: architecture/public-api-backend.md#common-response-schema]
```json
{
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "category": "otp_phishing|payment_scam|impersonation|unknown",
  "explanation": "human-friendly one-liner",
  "ts": "2025-10-18T02:30:00Z"
}
```

### Component Integration
[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]
- Companion App (SwiftUI) shows history and displays scan results
- Result view should display after scan completes
- Integration with App Group for keyboard sync (future story)

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Main result view: `TypeSafe/Views/ScanResultView.swift` (already exists, needs enhancement)
- Unit tests: `TypeSafeTests/ScanResultViewTests.swift` (needs creation)
- Navigation handled in: `TypeSafe/Views/OCRTextPreviewView.swift` (already integrated)

### Risk Level Color Coding
[Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- Low: Green
- Medium: Amber 
- High: Red
Color coding should be consistent with keyboard banner colors for user familiarity.

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- ScanResultView receives data from POST /scan-image response
- Should prepare data for App Group storage (minimal flag for keyboard)
- History storage will be handled in future story (3.6)

### Technical Constraints
- SwiftUI-based implementation (consistent with app architecture)
- iOS 16.0+ minimum target support
- Dark mode support required
- Accessibility labels for VoiceOver support

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/observability-testing.md]
- iOS UI tests: app scan flow e2e testing
- Unit tests for view logic and formatting
- Test file location: `TypeSafeTests/` directory
- Follow existing test patterns from `APIServiceTests.swift`

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test risk level color coding accuracy
- Test confidence percentage formatting (0.0-1.0 to percentage)
- Test timestamp formatting for user readability
- Test navigation actions and state management
- Test accessibility compliance

### Completion Notes List
- **Enhanced ScanResultView**: Added timestamp display with user-friendly formatting using ISO8601DateFormatter and DateFormatter
- **Color Coding Update**: Changed medium risk color from orange to amber (Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.75, blue: 0.0)) as specified in requirements
