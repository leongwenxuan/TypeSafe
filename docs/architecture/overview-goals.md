# Overview & Goals

TypeSafe v1 is an **iOS keyboard extension** + **companion app** with a lightweight **backend** that performs AI-assisted scam detection on **typed text** and **user-triggered screenshots**.

**Primary goals**
- Real-time text risk detection with clear inline feedback.
- On-device OCR + backend multimodal analysis for screenshots.
- Strict privacy: explicit consent, minimal data, short retention.
- Simplicity suitable for hackathon demo, but forward-compatible with v2 ILM.

**Non-goals (v1)**
- No background monitoring.
- No partner dashboards / sponsor flows.
- No multi-language (English-only).
