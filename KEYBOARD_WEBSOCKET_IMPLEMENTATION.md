# Keyboard WebSocket Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented WebSocket support in the TypeSafe keyboard extension to handle agent-based scam analysis with real-time progress updates.

## Problem

The keyboard extension was failing with "unable to analyse screenshot" error because:
1. Backend was returning agent responses with `type: "agent"`, `task_id`, and `ws_url`
2. Keyboard's `ScanResponse` model only supported simple responses
3. No WebSocket implementation to handle agent progress

## Solution

### 1. Updated ScanResponse Model ✅
**File**: `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardAPIService.swift`

- Added `type` field to distinguish simple vs agent responses
- Made all simple response fields optional (`riskLevel?`, `confidence?`, etc.)
- Added agent response fields (`taskId`, `wsUrl`, `estimatedTime`, `entitiesFound`)
- Added `isAgentResponse` computed property

```swift
struct ScanResponse: Codable {
    let type: String
    
    // Simple response fields
    let riskLevel: String?
    let confidence: Double?
    //...
    
    // Agent response fields
    let taskId: String?
    let wsUrl: String?
    //...
    
    var isAgentResponse: Bool {
        return type == "agent"
    }
}
```

### 2. Created WebSocket Manager ✅
**File**: `TypeSafeKeyboard/Services/KeyboardWebSocketManager.swift`

New file with:
- `KeyboardWebSocketManager` class for WebSocket connections
- `AgentProgressUpdate` model for progress messages
- `AgentFinalResult` model for completion
- Real-time message handling with callbacks
- Automatic reconnection and error handling

Features:
- ✅ Connects to backend WebSocket URL
- ✅ Receives progress updates (0-100%)
- ✅ Receives final analysis result
- ✅ Error handling and disconnection
- ✅ Memory-efficient for keyboard extension

### 3. Updated KeyboardViewController ✅
**File**: `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift`

Changes:
1. Added `webSocketManager` property
2. Updated scan response handler to check `isAgentResponse`
3. Created `handleAgentResponse()` method that:
   - Extracts `wsUrl` and `taskId`
   - Shows "Analyzing..." banner
   - Connects WebSocket
   - Updates banner with progress
   - Shows final result when complete

4. Added progress UI methods:
   - `showAnalyzingBanner(estimatedTime:)` - Shows blue analyzing banner
   - `updateAnalyzingBanner(progress:message:)` - Updates progress text
   - Converts final agent result to `ScanResponse` format

### 4. Progress Banner UI ✅

**Analyzing State:**
```
🔍 Analyzing... (5-30 seconds)
🔍 45% - Checking phone number...
🔍 78% - Analyzing domain reputation...
```

**Completion:**
- Shows same result banner as simple responses
- Includes risk level, confidence, and explanation

## How It Works

```
1. User takes screenshot
2. Keyboard detects & scans
3. Backend returns agent response with WebSocket URL
4. Keyboard shows "Analyzing..." banner
5. WebSocket connects & receives progress updates
6. Banner updates in real-time (0% → 100%)
7. Final result received → Show risk banner
8. WebSocket disconnects
```

## Testing

**To Test:**
1. Clean build Xcode project (`Cmd + Shift + K`)
2. Delete TypeSafe app from iPhone
3. Rebuild and install (`Cmd + R`)
4. Enable TypeSafe keyboard
5. Take screenshot with entities (phone, URL, email)
6. Watch keyboard banner show progress in real-time

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Blue "Analyzing..." banner appears
- ✅ Progress updates every 1-2 seconds
- ✅ Shows "45% - Checking phone number..." etc.
- ✅ Final result shows risk level with colored banner
- ✅ No more "unable to analyse screenshot" error

## Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ KeyboardViewController │
│  - Handles screenshot  │
│  - Shows UI banners    │
└──────────┬────────────┘
           │
           ├─► KeyboardAPIService
           │   └─► POST /scan-image
           │       ← { type: "agent", ws_url, task_id }
           │
           └─► KeyboardWebSocketManager
               └─► Connect to wss://...
                   ← Progress updates
                   ← Final result
```

## Benefits

1. **Real-time Feedback** - Users see progress, not just "analyzing..."
2. **Better UX** - Know what the agent is checking (phone, URL, etc.)
3. **No Errors** - Keyboard handles both simple and agent responses
4. **Efficient** - WebSocket is lightweight, perfect for keyboard
5. **Consistent** - Same agent analysis in keyboard and main app

## Files Changed

- ✅ `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardAPIService.swift` - Updated `ScanResponse` model
- ✅ `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Added WebSocket handling
- ✅ `TypeSafeKeyboard/Services/KeyboardWebSocketManager.swift` - New WebSocket manager

## Backend Changes

No backend changes required! The WebSocket implementation already exists and works perfectly.

## Next Steps

1. Test on physical device with various scam screenshots
2. Monitor WebSocket connection stability
3. Add analytics to track agent vs simple path usage
4. Consider adding timeout handling (if WebSocket takes > 30s)
