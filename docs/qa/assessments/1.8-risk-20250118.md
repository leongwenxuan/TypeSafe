## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## Risk Details

### 1. PERF-001: Database Query Efficiency

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**
**Probability**: Low - The current implementation performs 2 separate queries instead of a single UNION query
**Impact**: Low - Expected query time is well under 100ms even with 2 queries; unlikely to breach 500ms p95 target

**Affected Components**:
- `backend/app/db/operations.py` lines 162-175 (get_latest_result function)

**Mitigation**:
- Current implementation is acceptable for MVP/hackathon scale (50 rps)
- Database indexes on (session_id, created_at) exist from migrations
- If performance becomes an issue, refactor to single UNION ALL query
- Testing confirms response times are within acceptable range

**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance test added to verify < 500ms response time
- Load testing recommended if scaling beyond 50 rps

**Residual Risk**: Very low - Design supports target performance

---

### 2. DATA-001: Timestamp Parsing Edge Cases

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Edge cases with timezone formats
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause incorrect "most recent" determination

**Affected Components**:
- `backend/app/db/operations.py` lines 199-200 (timestamp comparison logic)

**Detection**: Code review revealed timestamp parsing assumes specific format with "Z" suffix

**Mitigation**:
- Current code handles ISO 8601 format with Z suffix correctly
- Supabase returns consistent timestamptz format
- Added unit tests for timestamp comparison logic in db operations tests
- Fallback: If timestamps equal, scan_result is returned (deterministic behavior)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Unit tests verify correct handling of timestamp formats
- Integration tests verify behavior when both tables have results

**Residual Risk**: Low - Supabase guarantees consistent format

---

### 3. OPS-001: Database Index Verification

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Indexes may not be optimally configured
**Impact**: Medium - Could affect query performance at scale

**Affected Components**:
- Database tables: `text_analyses`, `scan_results`
- Queries on (session_id, created_at) columns

**Mitigation**:
- Story Dev Notes mention indexes needed on (session_id, created_at DESC)
- Migrations 002 and 003 should include index definitions
- Recommend verifying indexes exist in production deployment
- Add EXPLAIN ANALYZE to validate query plans during deployment

**Testing Requirements**:
- Performance test validates query time < 100ms
- Manual verification of index existence during deployment
- Consider adding automated index checks to deployment scripts

**Residual Risk**: Low - Will be caught during deployment verification

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

No critical risks identified.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

No high risks identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Performance Tests**:
- Response time measurement (< 500ms target) ✅ Implemented
- Database query timing verification ✅ Covered in integration tests

**Data Integrity Tests**:
- Timestamp comparison logic (both tables exist) ✅ Implemented
- Edge case: timestamps equal ✅ Covered by deterministic fallback

**Operational Tests**:
- Query plan verification (manual during deployment)
- Index existence check (manual during deployment)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are low severity with acceptable mitigation.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- PERF-001: Current 2-query approach acceptable for MVP scale
- DATA-001: Timestamp parsing tested and validated
- OPS-001: Index verification deferred to deployment checklist

### Accepted Risks

- Two-query approach may need optimization at scale beyond 50 rps (acceptable for MVP)
- Manual index verification required during deployment (acceptable operational risk)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Response time metrics for /results/latest endpoint (target p95 < 500ms)
- Database query duration for get_latest_result function
- Error rates (404 vs 500 to identify issues)
- Query count per session (to identify if indexes are being used)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Traffic exceeds 50 rps consistently
- Response times approach 500ms p95
- Database schema changes affect text_analyses or scan_results tables
- Query patterns change (e.g., need to retrieve multiple results)
