# NFR Assessment: 1.3

Date: 2025-01-18
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

<!-- Note: Story is in Draft status - assessment based on requirements -->

## Summary

- Security: FAIL - No API key security implementation found
- Performance: FAIL - No timeout or caching implementation
- Reliability: FAIL - No error handling implementation
- Maintainability: FAIL - No code or tests exist yet

## Critical Issues

1. **No implementation exists** (All NFRs)
   - Risk: Cannot assess quality without code
   - Fix: Complete all 6 tasks in story before review

2. **API key security not implemented** (Security)
   - Risk: Potential API key exposure
   - Fix: Implement secure configuration loading and sanitized logging

3. **No timeout implementation** (Performance)
   - Risk: Could exceed <2s response time target
   - Fix: Implement 1.5s timeout with asyncio.wait_for

4. **No error handling** (Reliability)
   - Risk: System crashes or undefined behavior
   - Fix: Handle all OpenAI error types with graceful fallbacks

5. **No test coverage** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Cannot verify correctness
   - Fix: Create comprehensive test suite with >80% coverage

## Detailed NFR Assessment

### Security (FAIL)

**Target**: Secure API key management, data minimization, privacy-conscious logging

**Current State**: No implementation exists

**Requirements from Story**:
- Store OpenAI API key in .env (gitignored)
- Load via config.py
- Never log API keys
- Don't log full text snippets
- Log only sanitized metadata (text length, latency)

**Gaps**:
- ❌ API key loading not implemented
- ❌ Log sanitization not implemented
- ❌ Privacy-conscious error handling not implemented

**Action Required**:
- Implement secure config loading (config.py already has skeleton)
- Add error handling that sanitizes logs
- Test that logs never contain sensitive data

**Testing Needs**:
- Verify API key loads from environment
- Verify error messages don't contain API key
- Verify logs contain only metadata, not full text

### Performance (FAIL)

**Target**: <2s p95 for /analyze-text endpoint; OpenAI timeout 1.5s; caching enabled

**Current State**: No implementation exists

**Requirements from Story**:
- 1.5s timeout on OpenAI calls
- 60s TTL in-memory cache
- Cache key: SHA256 hash of text
- Max 100 cache entries
- <2s overall response time target

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Timeout not implemented
- ❌ Caching not implemented
- ❌ Performance monitoring not implemented

**Action Required**:
- Implement asyncio.wait_for with 1.5s timeout
- Create cache.py with TTL-based in-memory cache
- Add latency logging for monitoring

**Testing Needs**:
- Mock slow OpenAI response (>1.5s)
- Verify timeout triggers
- Verify cache stores/retrieves correctly
- Verify cache expires after 60s

### Reliability (FAIL)

**Target**: Graceful error handling, fallback responses, no crashes

**Current State**: No implementation exists

**Requirements from Story**:
- Handle timeout → return "unknown" risk
- Handle rate limit (429) → return "unavailable" response
- Handle auth error (401) → log critical error
- Handle server error (500+) → return fallback
- Handle malformed JSON → return "unknown"

**Gaps**:
- ❌ Error handling not implemented
- ❌ Fallback responses not defined
- ❌ Logging not implemented

**Action Required**:
- Implement try-except blocks for all OpenAI calls
- Define structured fallback responses
- Add error logging with request context

**Testing Needs**:
- Mock timeout scenarios
- Mock various OpenAI error types (429, 401, 500)
- Mock malformed JSON responses
- Verify all return structured fallback responses

### Maintainability (FAIL)

**Target**: >80% test coverage, clear code structure, well-documented

**Current State**: No code or tests exist

**Requirements from Story**:
- Test coverage >80%
- Clear module structure (services/, tests/)
- Documented prompt design rationale
- Unit tests with mocked OpenAI responses

**Gaps**:
- ❌ No code exists
- ❌ No tests exist
- ❌ No documentation exists

**Action Required**:
- Create service modules (openai_service.py, prompts.py, cache.py)
- Create test modules (test_openai_service.py, test_prompts.py, test_cache.py)
- Document prompt engineering decisions
- Achieve >80% coverage

**Testing Needs**:
- Comprehensive unit test suite
- Mock all OpenAI API calls
- Test all error paths
- Verify coverage target met

## Quick Wins

Priority fixes that can be implemented quickly:

1. **Add openai>=1.0.0 to requirements.txt** (~1 minute)
2. **Create service directory structure** (~1 minute)
3. **Implement basic OpenAI client initialization** (~30 minutes)
4. **Add timeout parameter** (~15 minutes)
5. **Create basic test file with first test** (~30 minutes)
