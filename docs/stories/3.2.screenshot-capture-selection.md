# Story 3.2: Screenshot Capture & Selection

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to select or capture screenshots to scan for scams,  
**so that** I can analyze suspicious messages I receive.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. "Scan My Screen" button prominently displayed on Scan tab
2. Tapping button opens iOS Photo Picker (PHPickerViewController)
3. User can select existing screenshots from Photos library
4. Selected image displayed in preview before scanning
5. Option to capture new screenshot (via iOS screenshot mechanism)
6. Image format validation (PNG, JPEG supported)
7. Error handling for unsupported formats or access denied

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Story 3.1 established the main app UI structure with SwiftUI-based tab navigation. The ScanView placeholder is already implemented and ready for screenshot capture functionality integration.

### Photo Picker Integration
**Framework**: PhotosUI framework with PHPickerViewController
- Import PhotosUI in ScanView.swift
- Use PHPickerConfiguration to configure image selection
- Set filter to `.images` to show only photos
- Enable single selection mode (selectionLimit = 1)
- Present picker using UIViewControllerRepresentable wrapper

**Source**: [docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]

### Image Format Support
**Supported Formats**: PNG, JPEG (as specified in acceptance criteria)
- Validate selected image format using UTType
- Display error alert for unsupported formats (GIF, HEIC, etc.)
- Handle Photos library access permission denial gracefully

### Screenshot Capture Flow
**iOS Screenshot Integration**: 
- Guide user to take screenshot using iOS native mechanism (Power + Volume Up)
- After screenshot, user returns to app and selects from Photos
- No programmatic screenshot capture needed (iOS handles this)

### UI/UX Implementation
**Preview Display**: 
- Show selected image in preview area before proceeding to OCR
- Implement image scaling/fitting for different screen sizes
- Add "Use This Image" and "Choose Different" action buttons
- Maintain consistent TypeSafe branding (blue accent color)

**Source**: [TypeSafe/Views/ScanView.swift] - existing placeholder structure

### Error Handling Requirements
**Permission Scenarios**:
- Photos access denied: Show alert with Settings redirect
- No photos available: Show appropriate empty state message
- Image loading failure: Display retry option with clear error message

**Source**: [docs/architecture/security-privacy.md] - privacy-first approach

### Technical Implementation Notes
**SwiftUI Integration**:
- Use @State for managing picker presentation and selected image
- Implement UIViewControllerRepresentable for PHPickerViewController
- Handle image data conversion from PHPickerResult to UIImage
- Maintain responsive UI during image loading operations

**File Structure**:
- Update existing `TypeSafe/Views/ScanView.swift`
- Create new `TypeSafe/Views/PhotoPickerView.swift` for picker wrapper
- Add image preview components within ScanView

**Source**: [docs/architecture/appendix-example-swift-pseudocode.md] - Swift implementation patterns

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Photo picker configuration and presentation logic
- Image format validation functions
- Error handling for various failure scenarios
- State management for picker presentation and image selection

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end photo selection flow
- Permission handling integration with iOS Photos
- Image preview display and user interaction
- Error recovery and retry mechanisms

### Device Testing
- Test on physical iOS device for realistic photo picker behavior
- Validate screenshot capture process with actual iOS screenshot mechanism
- Test with various image sizes and formats from Photos library
- Verify performance with large image files

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Photo picker opens when "Scan My Screen" button is tapped
- [ ] User can successfully select images from Photos library
- [ ] Selected image displays in preview with proper scaling
- [ ] Image format validation works for PNG/JPEG (rejects others)
