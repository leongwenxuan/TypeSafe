# Story 4.2: Screenshot Alert Prompt in Keyboard

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** keyboard user,  
**I want** to be notified when I take screenshots while typing,  
**so that** I can quickly scan them for scams without switching apps manually.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Keyboard polls App Group storage for screenshot notifications every 2 seconds
2. When notification detected, displays banner: "Screenshot taken - Scan for scams?"
3. Banner includes "Scan Now" button and dismiss "X" button  
4. Banner styled consistently with existing risk alert banners (Story 2.4)
5. Tapping "Scan Now" launches companion app via URL scheme (`typesafe://scan`)
6. Banner auto-dismisses after 15 seconds if not interacted with
7. Only shows notifications from last 60 seconds (respects expiration)
8. User can disable feature via Settings toggle: "Screenshot Scan Prompts"
9. Banner does not block keyboard typing functionality

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 2.4 (Inline Risk Alert Banners):**
- Alert banner UI framework established in keyboard
- Color-coded banner system (amber/red for medium/high risk)
- Auto-dismiss functionality (10-second timeout)
- Non-blocking banner design that preserves typing functionality

**From Story 2.7 (App Group Shared State):**
- SharedStorageManager integrated in keyboard extension
- App Group polling patterns established
- Privacy-safe shared data reading implemented
- Settings synchronization via shared storage

**From Story 4.1 (Screenshot Detection):**
- ScreenshotNotification data model defined
- App Group storage key: `"screenshot_notifications"`
- 60-second expiration and cleanup logic
- Debouncing and privacy compliance established

### Architecture Context

**[Source: docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]**
- Keyboard Extension displays inline risk banners and explain popover
- Read/write minimal state via App Group (e.g., latest scan verdict)
- Must maintain keyboard performance and responsiveness

**[Source: docs/prd/epic-4-screenshot-notifications.md]**
- Polling frequency: every 2 seconds when keyboard active
- Banner message: "Screenshot taken - Scan for scams?"
- URL scheme: `typesafe://scan` for deep linking
- User control: Settings toggle for feature enable/disable

### Screenshot Notification Polling

**Polling Strategy:**
- Check App Group storage every 2 seconds when keyboard is active
- Pause polling when keyboard is inactive/dismissed
- Use background queue for storage reads to avoid blocking UI
- Cache last checked timestamp to avoid duplicate notifications

**Implementation Pattern:**
```swift
// In KeyboardViewController
private var screenshotPollingTimer: Timer?

private func startScreenshotPolling() {
    screenshotPollingTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 2.0, repeats: true) { _ in
        self.checkForScreenshotNotifications()
    }
}

private func checkForScreenshotNotifications() {
    // Background queue for storage access
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility).async {
        let notifications = SharedStorageManager.shared.getActiveScreenshotNotifications()
        // Process new notifications on main queue
    }
}
```

### Banner UI Integration

**Reuse Existing Alert Banner Framework:**
- Extend existing `RiskAlertBannerView` from Story 2.4
- Create new banner type: `ScreenshotAlertBanner`
- Maintain consistent styling and animation patterns
- Follow established auto-dismiss and interaction patterns

**Banner Design Specifications:**
- Background: Blue accent color (matches TypeSafe branding)
- Icon: ðŸ“¸ (camera emoji) to indicate screenshot context
- Message: "Screenshot taken - Scan for scams?"
- Buttons: "Scan Now" (primary) and "X" (dismiss)
- Animation: Slide down from top, slide up to dismiss

### URL Scheme Integration

**Deep Link Implementation:**
- URL Scheme: `typesafe://scan`
- Action: Launch companion app directly to scan interface
- Fallback: If app not installed, graceful handling (shouldn't occur in our use case)

**Implementation:**
```swift
private func launchCompanionApp() {
    guard let url = URL(string: "typesafe://scan") else { return }
    
    // iOS keyboard extensions can open URLs
    var responder: UIResponder? = self
    while responder != nil {
        if let application = responder as? UIApplication {
            application.open(url, options: [:], completionHandler: nil)
            break
        }
        responder = responder?.next
    }
}
```

### Settings Integration

**Privacy Control:**
- Setting key: `"screenshot_scan_prompts_enabled"`
- Default value: `true` (enabled by default)
- Storage: App Group UserDefaults for cross-app sync
- UI: Toggle in companion app Settings (Story 3.8)

**Settings Check:**
```swift
private func isScreenshotPromptsEnabled() -> Bool {
    return SharedStorageManager.shared.getBoolSetting(
        key: "screenshot_scan_prompts_enabled", 
        defaultValue: true
    )
}
```

### Performance Considerations

**Polling Optimization:**
- 2-second intervals balance responsiveness with battery efficiency
- Background queue prevents UI blocking during storage reads
- Timer paused when keyboard inactive to save resources
- Minimal memory footprint for notification tracking

**Memory Management:**
- Weak references in timer callbacks to prevent retain cycles
- Efficient notification deduplication to avoid duplicate banners
- Automatic cleanup of processed notifications

### User Experience Design

**Non-Intrusive Behavior:**
- Banner appears above keyboard, doesn't block typing
- Auto-dismiss after 15 seconds maintains typing flow
- User can continue typing while banner is displayed
- Clear visual distinction from risk alert banners

**Accessibility:**
- VoiceOver support for banner announcement
- Accessible button labels for "Scan Now" and dismiss actions
- Proper focus management when banner appears

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**
- Test polling logic and notification detection
- Test banner display and interaction handling
- Test URL scheme launching functionality
- Mock SharedStorageManager for isolated testing

**Integration Testing:**
- End-to-end flow: screenshot â†’ notification â†’ banner â†’ app launch
- Test across keyboard lifecycle (show/hide/switch apps)
- Test settings integration (enable/disable prompts)
- Performance testing (polling impact on keyboard responsiveness)

### File Locations

- Network calls require Full Access (not needed for this story)

**Performance Requirements:**
- Polling must not impact keyboard input latency (< 100ms target)
- Banner animations must be smooth (60fps)
- Memory usage for polling service < 1MB additional overhead

**Privacy Requirements:**
- No screenshot content accessed or stored by keyboard
- Only metadata (timestamps, IDs) processed
- User control via settings toggle
- Respects existing privacy preferences

3. **URL Scheme Deep Linking (Task 3):**
   - Implemented `typesafe://scan` URL scheme launching
   - Responder chain navigation to find UIApplication
   - Graceful error handling for failed launches
   - Automatic banner dismissal after launching app

4. **Auto-Dismiss Logic (Task 4):**
   - 15-second auto-dismiss timer (as per requirements)
   - Manual dismiss via "X" button
   - Non-blocking banner positioned above keyboard
   - Reuses existing autoDismissTimer infrastructure

5. **Settings Integration (Task 5):**
   - Added `screenshot_scan_prompts_enabled` key to SharedStorageManager
   - Default value: true (enabled by default)
   - Settings check on polling start and during polling
   - Dual-check: requires both detection enabled and prompts enabled

6. **KeyboardViewController Integration (Task 6):**
   - Initialized service in viewDidLoad
   - Polling starts/stops with keyboard lifecycle
   - Banner display coordination with existing banner system
   - Proper memory management with weak references
   - Separate 15-second timer for screenshot banners

7. **Unit Tests (Task 7):**
   - 15 comprehensive test cases covering:
     * Polling lifecycle (start/stop/restart)
     * Notification detection and deduplication
     * Expiration and age filtering
     * Settings integration
     * Memory management
     * Performance (2-second interval verification)
   - Mock SharedStorageManager for isolated testing
   - All tests passing with proper expectations

**Key Design Decisions:**

- **Separate Setting:** Used `screenshot_scan_prompts_enabled` separate from `screenshot_detection_enabled` to allow users to disable just the prompts while keeping detection active
- **Banner Reuse:** Leveraged existing banner infrastructure from Story 2.4 while creating screenshot-specific banner view
- **Polling Pattern:** Followed established pattern from Story 3.7 (scan result polling) for consistency
- **Timer Management:** Separate 15-second timer for screenshot banners vs 10-second for scan results
- **Accessibility:** Comprehensive VoiceOver support following iOS best practices

**Testing Coverage:**

- Unit tests: ScreenshotNotificationServiceTests.swift (15 test cases)
- Manual testing required: End-to-end flow with real screenshots
- Performance testing: Polling interval accuracy verified

**Performance Considerations:**

- 2-second polling interval balances responsiveness and battery
- Background queue for storage reads prevents UI blocking
- Notification deduplication prevents duplicate banners
- Memory footprint: ~1MB additional for service + banner
- Timer properly invalidated on keyboard dismissal
