# Story 3.7: App Group Integration & Keyboard Sync

## Status=
Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** my keyboard to know about recent screenshot scans,  
**so that** I can see relevant alerts while typing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. App writes latest scan result to App Group shared storage
2. Shared data includes: risk_level, category, timestamp (no raw text)
3. Keyboard reads shared storage and displays confirmation banner
4. Banner in keyboard says "Latest scan: [Risk Level] - [Category]"
5. Shared state minimal (< 1KB) for privacy
6. App updates shared state immediately after scan completion

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 2.7 (App Group Shared State) - COMPLETED:**
- App Group identifier configured: `group.com.typesafe.shared`
- SharedStorageManager.swift utility class implemented
- Shared UserDefaults suite created for App Group
- Privacy-safe data structure for shared state established
- Settings synchronization via App Group UserDefaults working

**From Story 3.5 (Scan Result Display) - COMPLETED:**
- ScanResultView fully implemented with complete scan results
- Scan result data model: risk_level, confidence, category, explanation, timestamp
- "Save to History" functionality established
- Navigation patterns between scan flow screens working

**From Story 2.4 (Inline Risk Alert Banners) - COMPLETED:**
- RiskAlertBannerView implemented in keyboard extension
- Color-coded banner system (Green/Amber/Red for low/medium/high risk)
- Auto-dismiss functionality and non-blocking banner design
- Banner animation and positioning patterns established

### Architecture Context

**[Source: docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]**
- Keyboard Extension: Read/write minimal state via App Group (e.g., latest scan verdict)
- Display inline risk banners and explain popover
- Must maintain keyboard performance and responsiveness

**[Source: docs/architecture/security-privacy.md]**
- App Group: secure shared container for keyboardâ†”app flags only
- Minimization: send only small text snippets; screenshots optional
- Privacy-first approach with minimal data sharing

**[Source: docs/architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]**
- Screenshot Scan flow: Backend stores result; write small App Group flag for keyboard
- Keyboard polls shared storage; displays confirmation banner

**[Source: docs/prd/epic-3-companion-app.md#Story 3.7]**
- Priority: P1 (Enhancement - User Experience Improvement)
- Shared data includes: risk_level, category, timestamp (no raw text)
- Banner in keyboard says "Latest scan: [Risk Level] - [Category]"
- Shared state minimal (< 1KB) for privacy

### Shared Data Structure

**Screenshot Scan Result Data Model:**
```swift
struct SharedScanResult: Codable {
    let scanId: String              // UUID for deduplication
    let riskLevel: String           // "low", "medium", "high"
    let category: String            // e.g., "OTP Phishing", "Payment Scam"
    let confidence: Double          // 0.0 to 1.0
    let timestamp: Date             // When scan was completed
    let isNew: Bool                 // Whether keyboard has shown this result
}
```

**App Group Storage Keys:**
- `"latest_scan_result"` - Most recent screenshot scan result
- `"scan_result_version"` - Incremental version for change detection
- `"last_keyboard_check"` - When keyboard last read scan results

**Privacy Constraints:**
- No OCR text or explanation stored in shared storage
- No screenshot image data or thumbnails
- Only metadata required for banner display
- Total shared data < 1KB for privacy compliance

### Companion App Integration

**Write to Shared Storage (After Scan Completion):**
```swift
// In ScanResultView or APIService after successful scan
func updateSharedScanResult(_ result: ScanResult) {
    let sharedResult = SharedScanResult(
        scanId: UUID().uuidString,
        riskLevel: result.riskLevel,
        category: result.category,
        confidence: result.confidence,
        timestamp: Date(),
        isNew: true
    )
    
    SharedStorageManager.shared.setLatestScanResult(sharedResult)
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- Call after successful API response in scan flow
- Update immediately when scan completes (before showing ScanResultView)
- Increment version number for keyboard change detection
- Handle storage errors gracefully (don't block scan flow)

### Keyboard Extension Integration

**Read from Shared Storage (Polling Pattern):**
```swift
// In KeyboardViewController
private var scanResultPollingTimer: Timer?

private func startScanResultPolling() {
    scanResultPollingTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 5.0, repeats: true) { _ in
        self.checkForNewScanResults()
    }
}

private func checkForNewScanResults() {
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .utility).async {
        if let newResult = SharedStorageManager.shared.getLatestScanResult(),
           newResult.isNew {
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.showScanResultBanner(newResult)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Banner Display Integration:**
- Extend existing RiskAlertBannerView for scan result banners
- Different styling from text analysis banners (blue accent vs risk colors)
- Message format: "Latest scan: [Risk Level] - [Category]"
- Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds (shorter than risk banners)

### Banner Design Specifications

**Scan Result Banner Styling:**
- Background: Blue accent color (TypeSafe branding)
- Icon: ðŸ“¸ (camera emoji) to indicate screenshot scan
- Message: "Latest scan: Medium Risk - OTP Phishing"
- Dismiss: Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds or manual "X" button
- Animation: Slide down from top, consistent with risk banners

**Banner Differentiation:**
- Risk Analysis Banners: Amber/Red colors, warning icons
- Scan Result Banners: Blue color, camera icon
- Clear visual distinction to avoid user confusion
- Consistent positioning and animation patterns

### Performance Considerations

**Polling Optimization:**
- 5-second intervals balance responsiveness with battery efficiency
- Background queue prevents UI blocking during storage reads
- Timer paused when keyboard inactive to save resources
- Minimal memory footprint for result tracking

**Change Detection:**
- Version-based change detection to avoid duplicate banners
- Mark results as "read" after displaying banner
- Efficient deduplication to prevent banner spam
- Automatic cleanup of old scan results

### SharedStorageManager Extensions

**New Methods Required:**
```swift
extension SharedStorageManager {
    func setLatestScanResult(_ result: SharedScanResult) {
        // Store scan result and increment version
    }
    
    func getLatestScanResult() -> SharedScanResult? {
        // Retrieve latest scan result if new
    }
    
    func markScanResultAsRead(_ scanId: String) {
        // Mark result as read by keyboard
    }
    
    func clearOldScanResults() {
        // Cleanup results older than 24 hours
    }
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful fallback if shared storage unavailable
- Validation of shared data structure
- Corruption recovery (clear and restart)
- Logging for debugging without exposing user data

### User Experience Flow

**Complete Integration Flow:**
1. User completes screenshot scan in companion app
2. App receives scan result from backend
3. App writes result to App Group shared storage
4. Keyboard polls shared storage (every 5 seconds when active)
5. Keyboard detects new scan result
6. Keyboard displays confirmation banner: "Latest scan: High Risk - Payment Scam"
7. Banner auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
8. User continues typing with awareness of scan result

**Privacy Benefits:**
- No sensitive data crosses app boundaries
- User maintains awareness of scan results while typing
- Seamless integration without compromising privacy
- Optional feature (can be disabled in settings)

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `TypeSafe/Views/ScanResultView.swift` - Add shared storage update after scan
- `TypeSafe/Services/APIService.swift` - Update shared storage on successful scan
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/SharedStorageManager.swift` - Add scan result methods
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Add polling and banner logic

- Atomic read/write operations to prevent corruption
- Handle concurrent access from both apps

**Performance Requirements:**
- Polling must not impact keyboard input latency (< 100ms target)

- Memory usage for polling service < 500KB additional overhead
- Battery impact negligible (< 1% additional drain)

**Privacy Requirements:**
- No OCR text or explanation in shared storage
- No screenshot content or thumbnails
- Only metadata required for banner display
- User control via settings toggle (Story 3.8)
