## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story integrates OpenAI's GPT models for real-time scam intent detection on typed text. The OpenAI service will be called by the `/analyze-text` endpoint (Story 1.6) to provide risk assessments for text snippets captured by the keyboard extension.

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.3, #4.4]

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.1** established the FastAPI backend foundation with:
- Environment configuration in `backend/app/config.py` including `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- File structure: `backend/app/`, `backend/tests/`
- Testing infrastructure with pytest and 80%+ coverage target

**Story 1.2** established Supabase database layer:
- Database module in `backend/app/db/` for storing analysis results
- This story's OpenAI results will be stored via `insert_text_analysis()` in Story 1.6

This story creates the AI analysis capability that bridges the two foundations.

### OpenAI Integration Strategy

**API Choice: OpenAI Chat Completions**
- Model: `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fast, cost-effective for MVP)
- Alternative: `gpt-4-turbo` for higher accuracy if budget allows
- Structured outputs: Use prompt engineering to request JSON-formatted responses

**Prompt Engineering Focus:**
The prompt must effectively detect three scam categories:
1. **OTP Phishing**: Requests for one-time passwords, verification codes, 2FA codes
   - Examples: "send me your OTP", "share the verification code", "what's your 2FA?"
2. **Payment Scams**: Urgent payment requests, fake invoices, money transfer requests
   - Examples: "send $500 now", "pay this invoice immediately", "wire money to..."
3. **Impersonation**: Fake identity, authority figures, social engineering
   - Examples: "I'm from your bank", "this is the IRS", "I'm your CEO"

**Risk Level Classification:**
- **High**: Clear scam intent with high confidence (>0.8)
- **Medium**: Suspicious patterns but ambiguous context (0.5-0.8)
- **Low**: No scam indicators or benign content (<0.5)

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.4]

### Data Flow Integration

This OpenAI service will be used in the text analysis flow (Story 1.6):

1. Keyboard sends text to `POST /analyze-text` ← Story 1.6
2. Backend calls **`openai_service.analyze_text(text)`** ← This story implements this
3. Backend stores result in `text_analyses` table ← Story 1.2 enabled this
4. Backend returns risk JSON to keyboard

[Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.1]

### Performance Requirements

**Response Time Target**: <2s p95 for full `/analyze-text` endpoint
- OpenAI timeout: 1.5s (this story)
- Remaining 500ms for database write, network overhead

**Caching Strategy**:
- Cache identical text snippets to reduce API calls
- TTL: 60 seconds (short-lived, privacy-conscious)
- Cache key: SHA256 hash of normalized text (case-insensitive, trimmed)
- Max cache size: 100 entries (sufficient for hackathon scale)

**Concurrency**: 50 rps burst capacity
- OpenAI rate limits: ~3500 RPM for gpt-3.5-turbo (sufficient for MVP)
- If rate limits hit, graceful degradation to "unknown" risk level

[Source: architecture/performance-capacity.md]

### Security & Privacy Considerations

**API Key Security:**
- Store OpenAI API key in `.env` file (gitignored)
- Load via `backend/app/config.py` configuration
- Never log API keys or include in error messages

**Data Minimization:**
- Send only small text snippets to OpenAI (max 300 chars from keyboard)
- No PII sent to OpenAI (keyboard context is anonymized)
- Cache uses content hash, not raw text

**Logging Privacy:**
- Log request metadata (text length, model used, latency)
- DO NOT log full text snippets in production logs
- Log only sanitized information for debugging

[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

### OpenAI API Response Format

**Expected OpenAI Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "choices": [
    {
      "message": {
        "content": "{\"risk_level\": \"high\", \"confidence\": 0.92, \"category\": \"otp_phishing\", \"explanation\": \"Requesting OTP code is suspicious.\"}"
      }
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 150,
    "completion_tokens": 50
  }
}
```

**Normalization to Unified Schema:**
Parse the content field and validate/normalize to:
```python
{
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",  # Must be one of these three
  "confidence": float,               # 0.0-1.0 range
  "category": str,                   # otp_phishing|payment_scam|impersonation|unknown
  "explanation": str                 # Concise, human-friendly explanation
}
```

### File Structure

**New Files to Create:**
```
backend/app/services/
├── __init__.py              # Service module initialization
├── openai_service.py        # OpenAI client and analyze_text() function
├── prompts.py               # Scam detection prompt templates
└── cache.py                 # In-memory caching with TTL

backend/tests/
├── test_openai_service.py   # Unit tests with mocked OpenAI responses
├── test_prompts.py          # Prompt formatting tests
└── test_cache.py            # Cache behavior tests
```

**Modified Files:**
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Add openai>=1.0.0

### Error Handling Strategy

**Timeout Handling (1.5s):**
```python
try:
    response = await asyncio.wait_for(
        openai_client.chat.completions.create(...),
        timeout=1.5
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    return {
        "risk_level": "unknown",
        "confidence": 0.0,
        "category": "unknown",
        "explanation": "Analysis timed out"
    }
```

**OpenAI Error Handling:**
- **Rate Limit (429)**: Return "Analysis unavailable" response, log error
- **Auth Error (401)**: Critical error, log and alert (config issue)
- **Server Error (500+)**: Temporary failure, return "Analysis unavailable"
- **Invalid Response**: If OpenAI returns malformed JSON, return "unknown" risk

**Logging for Debugging:**
- Log all error types with context: `logger.error(f"OpenAI error: {error_type}, request_id: {request_id}")`
- Include text length in logs (not text content): `logger.info(f"Analyzed {len(text)} chars")`

### Testing

#### Testing Standards

**Test Framework**: pytest with unittest.mock for OpenAI API mocking  
**Test Location**: `backend/tests/test_openai_service.py`  
**Coverage Target**: >80% for OpenAI service module

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**

1. **Initialization Tests**
   - Test OpenAI client initializes with valid API key from config
   - Test initialization fails gracefully with missing API key
   - Test configuration loads OPENAI_API_KEY from environment

2. **Text Analysis Tests (with mocked responses)**
   - Mock successful OpenAI response → verify correct parsing
   - Test high-risk scam text → returns risk_level="high"
   - Test medium-risk suspicious text → returns risk_level="medium"  
   - Test benign text → returns risk_level="low"
   - Test empty text → handles gracefully
   - Test very long text (>1000 chars) → truncates or handles

3. **Timeout Tests**
   - Mock slow OpenAI response (>1.5s) → verify timeout triggered
   - Verify timeout returns fallback response with risk_level="unknown"
   - Test timeout logs appropriate error message

4. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Mock rate limit error (429) → returns error response
   - Mock authentication error (401) → logs critical error
   - Mock server error (500) → returns fallback response
   - Mock malformed JSON response → handles parsing error

5. **Caching Tests**
   - First call with text → calls OpenAI API
   - Second call with same text → returns cached response (no API call)
   - Test cache key generation (hash function)
   - Test cache expiration after TTL (60s)
   - Test cache eviction when max size reached

6. **Response Normalization Tests**
   - Test OpenAI response with all fields → normalized correctly
   - Test OpenAI response with missing fields → fills defaults
   - Test confidence score normalization (0.0-1.0 range)
   - Test category validation (only valid categories allowed)

**Test Execution:**
```bash
pytest backend/tests/test_openai_service.py -v --cov=backend/app/services
```

**Important**: Use `unittest.mock` to mock OpenAI API calls. Never make real API calls in unit tests (expensive and slow).

### Example Prompt (Initial Draft)

```python
SCAM_DETECTION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are a scam detection assistant. Analyze the following text for potential scam intent.

Classify the text into one of these risk levels:
- high: Clear scam indicators (OTP phishing, payment scams, impersonation)
- medium: Suspicious patterns but ambiguous context
- low: No scam indicators or benign content

Categories:
- otp_phishing: Requests for OTP, verification codes, 2FA
- payment_scam: Urgent payment requests, fake invoices
- impersonation: Fake identity, authority figures
- unknown: Cannot determine category

Return your analysis in this JSON format:
{
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "category": "otp_phishing|payment_scam|impersonation|unknown",
  "explanation": "Brief one-line explanation"
}
"""
```

This prompt will be refined based on testing results.

### Dependencies

**External Libraries:**
- `openai>=1.0.0` - Official OpenAI Python library
- `asyncio` - For async timeout handling (built-in)
- `hashlib` - For cache key generation (built-in)

**Internal Dependencies:**
- `backend/app/config.py` - For OPENAI_API_KEY configuration
- `backend/app/db/operations.py` - Future Story 1.6 will use this for storing results

### Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **OpenAI API latency** | High - Could miss <2s target | 1.5s timeout; cache responses; fallback to "unknown" |
| **OpenAI rate limits** | Medium - Could block requests | Monitor usage; implement backoff; cache aggressively |
| **Prompt ineffectiveness** | High - Poor scam detection | Iterative prompt testing; gather test examples; refine prompt |
| **API cost overruns** | Medium - Budget concerns | Use gpt-3.5-turbo (cheaper); cache aggressively; set usage alerts |
| **Response parsing errors** | Medium - Malformed JSON | Robust error handling; validate all fields; fallback to "unknown" |

### Next Steps (After This Story)

After Story 1.3 is complete:
- **Story 1.4**: Gemini integration for multimodal screenshot analysis (similar structure)
- **Story 1.5**: Risk aggregation to normalize outputs from multiple AI providers
- **Story 1.6**: Implement `POST /analyze-text` endpoint that uses this OpenAI service

## Testing

See "Testing" section in Dev Notes above for comprehensive testing requirements.

**Key Testing Principle**: All OpenAI API calls must be mocked in unit tests to avoid:
- Slow test execution
- Flaky tests due to network issues
- Unnecessary API costs during testing

Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` and return pre-defined responses.

   - Designed for consistent, low-temperature (0.3) responses

3. **Text Analysis Service** ✅
   - Implemented async `analyze_text()` function
   - Uses GPT-3.5-turbo model for cost-effectiveness
   - Returns normalized unified schema
   - Handles empty text, malformed responses, edge cases
   - Validates and clamps confidence scores to 0.0-1.0 range

4. **Timeout & Error Handling** ✅
   - OpenAI client configured with 1.5s timeout parameter
   - Comprehensive error handling for:
     - APITimeoutError → "Analysis timed out"
     - RateLimitError → "Analysis unavailable (rate limit)"
     - AuthenticationError → "Analysis unavailable (auth error)"
     - OpenAIError → "Analysis unavailable (API error)"
     - General exceptions → "Analysis failed unexpectedly"
   - All errors logged with context (text length, error type)
   - Fallback responses maintain unified schema structure

5. **Response Caching** ✅
   - Implemented TTLCache with 60s TTL and 100 entry max
   - Uses SHA256 hash of normalized text (lowercase, trimmed) as cache key
   - Caches successful responses only
   - Simple time-based expiration (oldest entry eviction when full)
   - Cache hit/miss logging for monitoring

6. **Comprehensive Testing** ✅
   - 37 tests across 3 test files
   - 97% code coverage (exceeds 80% target)
   - All OpenAI API calls mocked (no real API calls in tests)
   - Test coverage includes:
     - Client initialization (success and failure)
     - Response normalization and validation
     - All error scenarios (timeout, rate limit, auth, server errors)
     - Caching behavior (store, retrieve, expiration, normalization)
     - Empty text handling
     - Multiple risk levels (low, medium, high)

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Chose async implementation for better FastAPI integration in Story 1.6
- Used lazy client initialization to avoid startup failures
- Implemented simple TTL cache instead of LRU for MVP simplicity
- Selected gpt-3.5-turbo for balance of speed and cost
- Used built-in OpenAI client timeout instead of asyncio.wait_for
- Normalized cache keys to be case-insensitive for better hit rate

**Performance Characteristics:**
- OpenAI timeout: 1.5s (meets <2s p95 target with 500ms buffer)
- Cache hit avoids OpenAI API call entirely (<10ms response)
- Fallback responses return immediately on errors

**Security Measures:**
- API key loaded from environment only (never hardcoded)
- No API keys logged
- Text length logged, but not full content (privacy)
- Cache uses content hash, not raw text
