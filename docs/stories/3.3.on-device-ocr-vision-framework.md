# Story 3.3: On-Device OCR with Vision Framework

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** my screenshot text extracted locally on my device,  
**so that** my privacy is protected and OCR is fast.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Apple Vision Framework integrated (`VNRecognizeTextRequest`)
2. OCR runs on selected screenshot image
3. Text extraction supports English language (MVP)
4. Recognition level set to "accurate" for best results
5. Extracted text displayed in preview (editable text view)
6. User can review/edit OCR text before submitting for analysis
7. OCR processing time < 2s for typical screenshot
8. Error handling for OCR failures (displays message, allows retry)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Integrate Apple Vision Framework (AC: 1, 3, 4)
  - [x] Import Vision framework in relevant Swift files
  - [x] Create OCRService class to handle Vision OCR operations

  - [x] Handle VNRecognizeTextRequest execution asynchronously
  - [x] Extract recognized text from VNRecognizedTextObservation results
  - [x] Implement error handling for OCR failures
  - [x] Add performance monitoring to ensure < 2s processing time

  - [x] Create OCRTextPreviewView SwiftUI component
  - [x] Display extracted text in editable TextEditor
  - [x] Add "Edit Text" functionality for user corrections
  - [x] Provide clear visual indication of OCR vs user-edited text
  - [x] Add "Proceed with Analysis" and "Retry OCR" buttons

- [x] Task 4: Integrate OCR with Screenshot Flow (AC: 2, 8)
  - [x] Modify ScanView to call OCR after image selection
  - [x] Add loading state during OCR processing
  - [x] Handle transition from ImagePreviewView to OCRTextPreviewView
  - [x] Implement retry mechanism for failed OCR attempts
  - [x] Add progress indicators and user feedback

- [x] Task 5: Add Unit Tests for OCR Functionality
  - [x] Create OCRServiceTests.swift test file
  - [x] Test OCR processing with sample images
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios
  - [x] Test performance requirements (< 2s processing)
  - [x] Mock Vision framework responses for consistent testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.2 completion:
- PhotoPickerView and ImagePreviewView components are available and working
- ScanView has proper state management for different UI modes
- Image selection flow is complete and ready for OCR integration
- Error handling patterns established for permission and format validation

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]
- Companion App runs Apple Vision OCR locally using VNRecognizeTextRequest
- OCR text processing happens on-device for privacy protection
- Extracted text will be sent to backend, not the raw image (privacy-first approach)

[Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- Screenshot scan flow: App receives screenshot → runs Vision OCR locally → POST /scan-image with OCR text
- OCR text becomes the primary data sent to backend for analysis

[Source: architecture/appendix-example-swift-pseudocode.md]
- Example implementation: `let ocrText = runVisionOCR(image)`
- Integration pattern for scan flow established

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/key-constraints-assumptions.md]
- Privacy requirement: OCR processing must happen on-device
- No raw PII storage - only processed OCR text
- Latency target < 2s round trip aligns with AC requirement

[Source: architecture/performance-capacity.md]
- Performance target: < 2s processing time for OCR operations
- Must handle graceful degradation if OCR fails

[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Local-first processing: OCR on-device, screenshot upload is opt-in
- Minimization principle: send only OCR text, not raw images

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- OCR service: `TypeSafe/Services/OCRService.swift` (new directory)
- OCR preview UI: `TypeSafe/Views/OCRTextPreviewView.swift`
- Tests: `TypeSafeTests/OCRServiceTests.swift`
- Integration point: Modify existing `TypeSafe/Views/ScanView.swift`

### iOS Framework Requirements
- Vision framework import required
- VNRecognizeTextRequest for text recognition
- VNRecognizedTextObservation for result handling
- Async/await pattern for OCR processing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/observability-testing.md]
- iOS UI tests required for scan flow e2e testing
- Unit tests for OCR service functionality
- Performance testing to validate < 2s requirement
- Error scenario testing for OCR failures

## Testing

### Test File Location
- `TypeSafeTests/OCRServiceTests.swift` - Unit tests for OCR service
- `TypeSafeTests/OCRTextPreviewViewTests.swift` - UI component tests
- Integration with existing `TypeSafeTests/` test suite structure

### Testing Framework
- XCTest framework for unit and UI tests
- SwiftUI testing for preview component validation
- Performance testing using XCTMetric for timing validation

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test OCR accuracy with sample screenshot images
- Validate < 2s processing time requirement
- Test error handling for unsupported images or OCR failures
- Test text editing functionality in preview
- Verify privacy compliance (no data persistence during OCR)
