## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

This story establishes the foundational FastAPI backend service for TypeSafe. The backend serves as the central hub for AI-powered scam detection, handling requests from both the iOS keyboard extension and companion app.

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.3]

### Backend Component Overview

The Backend API (Python FastAPI) is responsible for:
- Exposing REST API endpoints: `/analyze-text`, `/scan-image`, `/results/latest`
- Integrating with OpenAI for text analysis and Gemini for multimodal analysis
- Normalizing AI provider outputs into unified risk schema
- Persisting results in Supabase (short retention, anonymized)

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.3]

### API Endpoints (To Be Implemented in Later Stories)

**POST /analyze-text**
- Body: `{ session_id, app_bundle, text }`
- Returns: `{ risk_level, confidence, category, explanation }`
- Errors: 400 (invalid input), 429 (rate limit), 500 (provider error)

**POST /scan-image**
- Body: multipart with `{ session_id, ocr_text, image? }`
- Returns: `{ risk_level, confidence, category, explanation }`

**GET /results/latest?session_id=...**
- Returns: most recent normalized result for the session

**Common Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "risk_level": "low|medium|high",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "category": "otp_phishing|payment_scam|impersonation|unknown",
  "explanation": "human-friendly one-liner",
  "ts": "2025-10-18T02:30:00Z"
}
```

### Deployment Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Local** | Dev iteration | Uvicorn + ngrok for device testing |
| **Staging** | Pre-demo | Test API keys, Supabase staging |
| **Prod (Demo)** | Live demo | Cloud host (Render/Vercel) + Cloudflare proxy |

Infrastructure approach: Dockerfile for FastAPI service, basic request logs, Supabase query stats.

[Source: architecture/deployment-environments.md]

### Performance Requirements

- **Response time targets**: <2s p95 for `/analyze-text`; <3.5s for `/scan-image`
- **Concurrency**: 50 rps burst (hackathon scale)
- **Caching**: short-lived in-memory cache for identical text checks (to be implemented later)
- **Resilience**: timeouts 1.5s per AI provider; graceful degradation if providers fail

[Source: architecture/performance-capacity.md]

### Security & Privacy Requirements

- **Transport**: HTTPS (TLS 1.3), HSTS on backend
- **Auth**: Backend API-key from iOS app; rotate keys via secrets manager
- **Minimization**: send only small text snippets; screenshots optional
- **Anonymization**: `session_id` = random UUID, no PII
- **Compliance**: Privacy-first design; no raw PII storage

[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

### Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **ASGI Server**: Uvicorn
- **Configuration**: python-dotenv for environment variables
- **External Services**: OpenAI API, Gemini API, Supabase (Postgres)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-18

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: EXCELLENT**

This is a well-executed foundational story with clean, professional Python code. The implementation demonstrates strong software engineering practices:

- **Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with distinct config and main modules
- **Code Quality**: Clean, readable code with comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- **Patterns**: Correct use of FastAPI middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns
- **Documentation**: Excellent inline documentation and comprehensive README/DEPLOY guides
- **Testing**: 87% coverage with well-organized test suite using pytest best practices

### Refactoring Performed

**1. File: backend/app/main.py**
- **Change**: Made HSTS header conditional on environment (production/staging only)
- **Why**: HSTS in development/test environments can cause issues with local HTTP testing
- **How**: Added environment check before adding Strict-Transport-Security header

**2. File: backend/app/main.py**  
- **Change**: Added production configuration comment for CORS
- **Why**: Default wildcard CORS is development-friendly but too permissive for production
- **How**: Added inline comment documenting need to set specific origins via CORS_ORIGINS env var

**3. File: backend/tests/test_main.py**
- **Change**: Updated security headers test to verify environment-aware HSTS behavior
- **Why**: Test needed to validate that HSTS is correctly NOT present in test environment
- **How**: Renamed test and updated assertion to verify HSTS is only added in production

All changes maintain backward compatibility and improve production readiness.

### Compliance Check

- ✅ **Coding Standards**: Clean Python code, proper use of type hints, comprehensive docstrings
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Standard FastAPI structure with proper separation of concerns  
- ✅ **Testing Strategy**: 87% coverage exceeds 80% target, well-organized test suite
- ✅ **All ACs Met**: All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

**Note**: File List in Dev Agent Record section should be updated to include test file modifications.

### Gate Status

This story exceeds quality expectations and is production-ready. The foundational architecture is solid and provides an excellent base for implementing the AI analysis endpoints in subsequent stories.

**Suggested Next Steps:**
1. Mark story as Done
2. Proceed with Story 1.2 (Supabase Database Setup)
3. Consider updating .gitignore to include pytest cache and __pycache__ if not already present
