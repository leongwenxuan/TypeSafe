# Story 2.7: App Group Shared State

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** keyboard extension,  
**I want** to share minimal state with the companion app via App Group,  
**so that** I can access latest screenshot scan results and sync settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. App Group identifier configured (`group.com.typesafe.shared`)
2. Shared `UserDefaults` suite created for App Group
3. Keyboard reads latest scan result flag from shared storage
4. Keyboard writes last analysis timestamp to shared storage
5. Settings (e.g., alert preferences) synced via App Group
6. Data stored is minimal and privacy-safe (no raw text)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Configure App Group Entitlement (AC: 1)
  - [x] Add App Group capability to main app target
  - [x] Add App Group capability to keyboard extension target
  - [x] Configure `group.com.typesafe.shared` identifier in both targets
  - [x] Update entitlements files for both targets

- [x] Task 2: Create Shared Storage Manager (AC: 2, 6)
  - [x] Create `SharedStorageManager.swift` utility class
  - [x] Initialize shared UserDefaults suite with App Group identifier
  - [x] Define privacy-safe data structure for shared state
  - [x] Implement read/write methods with error handling

- [x] Task 3: Implement Scan Result Sharing (AC: 3, 6)
  - [x] Define shared data keys for scan results
  - [x] Keyboard reads latest scan result (risk_level, category, timestamp only)
  - [x] Ensure no raw text or PII is stored in shared storage
  - [x] Add data validation and sanitization

- [x] Task 4: Implement Analysis Timestamp Tracking (AC: 4)
  - [x] Keyboard writes timestamp after each text analysis
  - [x] Track last analysis time for sync purposes
  - [x] Implement timestamp formatting and parsing

- [x] Task 5: Settings Synchronization (AC: 5)
  - [x] Define shared settings structure (alert preferences)
  - [x] Implement settings read/write through shared storage
  - [x] Add settings validation and default values
  - [x] Ensure settings changes propagate between app and keyboard

- [x] Task 6: Add Unit Tests
  - [x] Test SharedStorageManager functionality
  - [x] Test data privacy and sanitization
  - [x] Test settings synchronization
  - [x] Test error handling for shared storage failures

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 2.6 (Explain Why Popover Detail):**
- Keyboard extension architecture is well-established with `KeyboardViewController.swift`
- UI components follow consistent patterns in `TypeSafeKeyboard/UI/` directory
- Testing patterns established in `TypeSafeTests/` directory
- Source: Previous story implementation files

**From Story 2.3 (Backend API Integration):**
- Session management already implemented with anonymous UUID generation
- `SessionManager.swift` handles session persistence in UserDefaults
- API response models defined in `TypeSafeKeyboard/Models/AnalyzeTextModels.swift`
- Source: `TypeSafeKeyboard/Networking/SessionManager.swift`

### Component Specifications

**App Group Configuration:**
- Identifier: `group.com.typesafe.shared` [Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.1]
- Secure shared container for keyboardâ†”app flags only [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Minimal data storage (< 1KB) for privacy [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-companion-app.md Story 3.7]

**Shared Data Structure:**
- Latest scan result: risk_level, category, timestamp (no raw text) [Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- Settings: alert preferences, privacy toggles
- Analysis tracking: last analysis timestamp
- **CRITICAL**: No PII or raw text content stored [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]

**Data Flow Integration:**
- Companion app writes scan results to shared storage after completion [Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- Keyboard polls shared storage for latest scan results [Source: architecture/adr-snapshot-architecture-decision-records.md ADR-004]
- Settings changes propagate bidirectionally between app and keyboard

### File Locations

**New Files to Create:**
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/SharedStorageManager.swift` - Shared storage utility class
- `TypeSafeTests/SharedStorageManagerTests.swift` - Unit tests for shared storage

**Files to Modify:**
- `TypeSafe/TypeSafe.entitlements` - Add App Group capability
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/TypeSafeKeyboard.entitlements` - Add App Group capability
- `TypeSafeKeyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` - Integrate shared storage reading
- `TypeSafe.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Add App Group entitlements to targets

### Technical Constraints

**Privacy Requirements:**
- Store only anonymized, minimal data [Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- No raw text content in shared storage
- Data size limit: < 1KB total [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-companion-app.md Story 3.7]

**iOS App Group Limitations:**
- Shared UserDefaults suite requires proper entitlement configuration
- Both targets must have identical App Group identifier
- Data persistence tied to App Group container lifecycle

**Performance Considerations:**
- Shared storage access should be non-blocking for keyboard performance
- Implement caching to minimize UserDefaults reads
- Use background queue for shared storage writes

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing Standards:**
- Test file location: `TypeSafeTests/` directory
- Follow existing test patterns from `SessionManagerTests.swift`
- Test shared storage read/write operations
- Test data privacy and sanitization
- Test error handling for missing or corrupted shared data
- Mock App Group UserDefaults for isolated testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Verify App Group configuration works between targets
- Test data synchronization between app and keyboard
- Validate privacy constraints (no PII leakage)

4. **Privacy Compliance**: Implemented strict data validation to ensure no PII or raw text is stored in shared storage
5. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite covering all functionality including privacy validation and error handling
6. **Settings Integration**: Alert preferences and haptic feedback settings now read from shared storage

### File List
