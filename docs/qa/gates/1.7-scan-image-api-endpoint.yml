nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Comprehensive input validation (UUID, image format/size, text length).
      Privacy requirements met (no content logging, metadata only).
      Error messages sanitized. Image size limit (4MB) prevents DoS.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Architecture supports p95 < 3.5s target (Gemini 1.5s + OpenAI fallback 1.5s + overhead 0.5s).
      Service timeouts appropriately configured. Caching in place for OpenAI service.
      Recommendation: Monitor actual p95 in production.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Robust multi-provider integration with automatic fallback (Gemini â†’ OpenAI).
      Comprehensive error handling with appropriate status codes (400/422/500).
      Safe fallback response when both providers fail.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      Test coverage: 18 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios.
      Code follows established patterns from previous stories.
      Clear separation of concerns, leverages existing services.
      Advisory: Consider replacing deprecated imghdr (Python 3.13 compatibility).

notes: |
  Excellent implementation quality demonstrating production-ready code with:
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling
  - Robust multi-provider integration with automatic fallback
  - Privacy-conscious design (metadata logging only)
  - Thorough test coverage (18 tests, all passing)
  - Architectural consistency with previous stories
  
  No blocking issues identified. All acceptance criteria fully met.
  Advisory recommendations are future-oriented improvements, not current blockers.
  
  Story is ready for Done status.
