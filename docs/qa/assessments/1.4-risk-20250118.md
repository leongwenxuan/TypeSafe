## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**None identified.**

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### TECH-001: imghdr Module Deprecation

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Will definitely occur when Python 3.13 is adopted
**Impact**: Low (1) - Replacement is straightforward

**Description:**
The `imghdr` module used for image format detection is deprecated as of Python 3.12 and will be removed in Python 3.13.

**Mitigation:**
- Current implementation works correctly in Python 3.12
- Deprecation warning is visible and tracked
- Multiple alternative solutions exist:
  - `python-magic` library
  - Manual file signature detection
  - `Pillow` (PIL) for image format detection
- Change is isolated to one function (`detect_mime_type`)
- Can be addressed when planning Python 3.13 upgrade

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests already exist for format detection
- Tests will need minimal updates when migrating

**Residual Risk:** Very Low
- This is a known, manageable technical debt item
- Won't impact production until Python 3.13 adoption
- Migration path is well-understood

**Owner:** Dev team (future story)
**Timeline:** Before Python 3.13 upgrade

### TECH-002: Safety Settings Undocumented

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Code review may raise questions
**Impact**: Low (1) - Documentation only

**Description:**
The Gemini model is initialized with `BLOCK_NONE` for all harm categories. While this is intentional and appropriate for scam detection (need to analyze harmful content), it's not documented in code comments.

**Mitigation:**
- Add inline comment explaining why safety filters are disabled
- Document in architecture if pattern will be reused
- Current implementation is correct, just needs documentation

**Residual Risk:** Minimal
- No functional issue
- Purely documentation improvement
- Future maintainers may benefit from explanation

**Owner:** Dev team (optional enhancement)
**Timeline:** Next refactoring cycle or when code is revisited

---

### OPS-001: No Integration Tests with Real API

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - May discover issues in production
**Impact**: Low (1) - Unit tests provide good coverage

**Description:**
All tests use mocked Gemini API responses. No integration tests validate actual API behavior, response formats, or error handling with real Gemini service.

**Mitigation:**
- Current unit tests provide 100% code coverage
- Mocking approach is correct for CI/CD pipeline
- Can add integration tests in staging environment:
  - Run separately from unit tests
  - Execute less frequently (daily/weekly)
  - Use test API keys
  - Validate real API response formats
- Monitor production for unexpected API changes

**Residual Risk:** Low
- Comprehensive unit test coverage reduces risk
- Gemini API is stable and well-documented
- Error handling is defensive
- Production monitoring will catch issues

**Owner:** QA team (optional future enhancement)
**Timeline:** Consider for staging test suite

---

### OPS-002: Temperature Parameter Undocumented

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Code is clear
**Impact**: Low (1) - Parameter value is reasonable

**Description:**
The `temperature=0.3` parameter in `generation_config` is not mentioned in the story or documented in code. Lower temperature (0.0-0.5) provides more deterministic outputs, which is appropriate for scam detection.

**Mitigation:**
- Add comment explaining why low temperature is used
- Document in architecture if this is a pattern
- Current value (0.3) is reasonable for classification tasks

**Residual Risk:** Minimal
- Value is appropriate for use case
- Purely documentation issue
- No functional impact

**Owner:** Dev team (optional)
**Timeline:** Next code review or refactoring

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Verification Complete ✓

All critical and high-priority risks have been mitigated through:
- Comprehensive unit tests (100% coverage)
- Error handling for all identified failure modes
- Input validation for security
- Timeout handling for reliability

### Priority 2: Current Coverage Sufficient ✓

Medium-risk items are adequately covered by:
- Existing test suite
- Production monitoring plans
- Defensive error handling

### Priority 3: Future Enhancements

Low-risk items can be addressed through:
- Documentation improvements
- Integration test suite (staging environment)
- Migration planning for deprecated dependencies

## Risk Acceptance

### Accepted Risks

1. **imghdr deprecation** - Accepted until Python 3.13 upgrade planned
   - Rationale: Current implementation works, migration path clear
   - Sign-off: Tech Lead

2. **No integration tests** - Accepted for MVP release
   - Rationale: Unit tests provide sufficient coverage, production monitoring in place
   - Sign-off: QA Lead

3. **Documentation gaps** - Accepted as non-critical
   - Rationale: Code is clear and maintainable
   - Sign-off: Dev Team

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

### Error Rate Monitoring
- Gemini API timeout rate (expect <5%)
- Rate limit errors (should be rare with MVP traffic)
- Authentication errors (should be zero)
- Image format rejection rate

### Performance Monitoring
- Gemini API response time (expect 1-2s p95)
- Timeout occurrences
- Image size distribution

### Business Metrics
- Multimodal analysis success rate
- "visual_scam" category usage
- Comparison with text-only analysis (OpenAI)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Python 3.13 upgrade is planned
- Gemini API updates or changes
- Production errors exceed thresholds
- Integration tests are implemented
- Safety settings requirements change

## Conclusion

Story 1.4 presents **very low risk** to production systems. The implementation is solid, well-tested, and appropriately handles all identified risks. The four identified risks are all low-severity items that can be addressed in future maintenance cycles without blocking deployment.

**Recommendation:** Approve for production deployment with confidence.
