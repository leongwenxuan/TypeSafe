# Story 4.1: Screenshot Detection & Notification

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** companion app,  
**I want** to detect when the user takes screenshots,  
**so that** I can notify the keyboard about potential scam content to analyze.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. App registers for `UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification`
2. Screenshot detection works when app is active, backgrounded, or suspended
3. Writes screenshot notification to App Group shared storage immediately
4. Notification includes: timestamp, detection flag, and notification ID
5. Shared data remains minimal and privacy-safe (no screenshot content stored)
6. Debounces multiple rapid screenshots (max 1 notification per 5 seconds)
7. Notification persists for 60 seconds then auto-expires
8. Works across all iOS versions 16.0+

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**From Story 3.5 (Scan Result Display) - COMPLETED:**
- Companion app scan result display fully implemented
- ScanResultView shows risk level, confidence, and explanations
- App Group integration for sharing scan results with keyboard
- Privacy-first result display with user controls

**From Story 2.7 (App Group Shared State) - COMPLETED:**
- App Group identifier configured: `group.com.typesafe.shared`
- SharedStorageManager class implemented for App Group data sharing
- Keyboard reads latest scan result flag from shared storage
- Settings synchronization via App Group UserDefaults established
- Privacy-safe data sharing patterns (no raw text, minimal metadata only)

**From Story 3.4 (Backend Integration) - COMPLETED:**
- APIService.swift implemented for backend communication
- Session ID generation and persistence in UserDefaults
- Multipart form data handling for image uploads
- Network error handling and retry mechanisms established

### Architecture Context

**[Source: docs/architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]**
- Companion App: "Scan My Screen" entrypoint; receives user-selected screenshot
- Run Apple Vision OCR locally (VNRecognizeTextRequest)
- Upload OCR text + (optionally) the image to backend for analysis
- Show history (last 5 results) and settings (privacy, voice)

**[Source: docs/architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]**
- Screenshot Scan flow: Companion app receives screenshot → runs Vision OCR locally
- POST /scan-image with OCR text + (optional) image
- Backend → Gemini (image+text) + OpenAI (text) → aggregate
- Persist in Supabase; return verdict; write small App Group flag for keyboard
- Keyboard polls shared storage; displays confirmation banner

**[Source: docs/architecture/security-privacy.md]**
- App Group: secure shared container for keyboard↔app flags only
- Minimization: send only small text snippets; screenshots optional
- Anonymization: session_id = random UUID, no PII
- Local-first: OCR on-device; screenshot upload is opt-in

**[Source: docs/prd/epic-4-screenshot-notifications.md]**
- Screenshot detection flow: iOS notification → App Group write → Keyboard poll
- Data structure: timestamp, ID, expiration for notification management
- URL scheme integration: typesafe://scan for deep linking back to app
- Privacy controls: user can disable feature via Settings toggle

### Screenshot Detection Implementation

**iOS Framework Integration:**
```swift
// Register for screenshot notifications in AppDelegate/SceneDelegate
NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
    forName: UIApplication.userDidTakeScreenshotNotification,
    object: nil,
    queue: .main
) { _ in
    ScreenshotNotificationManager.shared.handleScreenshotTaken()
}
```

**Notification Data Model:**
```swift
struct ScreenshotNotification: Codable {
    let id: String              // UUID for deduplication
    let timestamp: Date         // When screenshot was taken
    let isActive: Bool          // Whether notification is still valid
    let expiresAt: Date         // Auto-expiration (timestamp + 60s)
}
```

### App Group Integration

**Shared Storage Key:** `"screenshot_notifications"`
**Storage Location:** App Group UserDefaults (`group.com.typesafe.shared`)
**Data Format:** JSON array of ScreenshotNotification objects

**Integration with Existing SharedStorageManager:**
- Extend existing `SharedStorageManager.swift` with screenshot notification methods
- Follow established privacy and data validation patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing shared storage architecture

### Privacy & Performance Requirements

**Privacy Compliance:**
- No screenshot image content stored in shared storage
- Only metadata (timestamp, ID, flags) shared between apps
- Respects existing privacy settings and user controls
- Auto-expiration prevents data accumulation

**Performance Optimization:**
- Debouncing prevents notification spam (5-second minimum interval)
- Automatic cleanup of expired notifications
- Minimal data footprint (< 100 bytes per notification)
- Efficient JSON serialization for shared storage

### App Lifecycle Handling

**Background Detection:**
- Screenshot notifications work when app is backgrounded
- iOS delivers notifications even when app is not active
- Shared storage writes must be atomic and reliable
- Handle app suspension/termination gracefully

**Notification Reliability:**
- Use background app refresh if available
- Implement retry logic for failed shared storage writes
- Log notification events for debugging (without sensitive data)

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing:**
- Test screenshot notification creation and storage
- Test debouncing logic (multiple rapid screenshots)
- Test expiration and cleanup functionality
- Mock UIApplication notifications for reliable testing

**Integration Testing:**
- Test across app lifecycle states (active, background, suspended)
- Test App Group shared storage integration
- Test notification persistence and retrieval
- Validate privacy compliance (no sensitive data stored)

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `TypeSafe/TypeSafeApp.swift` - Register for screenshot notifications
- `TypeSafe/SharedStorageManager.swift` - Add screenshot notification methods

**New Files to Create:**
- `TypeSafe/Services/ScreenshotNotificationManager.swift` - Core notification handling
- `TypeSafe/Models/ScreenshotNotification.swift` - Data model
- `TypeSafeTests/ScreenshotNotificationManagerTests.swift` - Unit tests

### Technical Constraints

**iOS Limitations:**
- Screenshot notifications only available when app has been launched recently
- Background app refresh affects notification reliability
- App Group storage has size limitations (should not be an issue with minimal data)

**Privacy Requirements:**
- Must comply with existing TypeSafe privacy standards
- No PII or sensitive data in shared storage
- User must be able to disable feature via Settings

**Performance Requirements:**
- Minimal impact on app launch time and memory usage
- Efficient shared storage operations
- No blocking of main thread during notification handling

### Debug Log References

Build Status: ✅ BUILD SUCCEEDED
- xcodebuild -scheme TypeSafe -sdk iphonesimulator build
- No compilation errors or warnings
- All new files properly integrated into Xcode project

### Privacy & Security Validation

✅ No screenshot images stored in App Group
✅ Only metadata (UUID, timestamp, flags) shared
✅ Privacy validation on all data writes
✅ Auto-expiration prevents data accumulation
✅ Storage size < 100 bytes per notification
✅ User can disable feature via Settings

### Testing Status

**Unit Tests:** ✅ Comprehensive test suite created (15 tests)
**Manual Tests:** ⚠️ Requires physical iOS device (simulator doesn't support screenshot notifications)
**Integration:** ✅ Verified with existing App Group infrastructure
**Build:** ✅ Clean build with no errors or warnings

### Known Limitations

1. Screenshot notifications only work on physical iOS devices (not in Simulator)
2. iOS may delay or drop notifications if app hasn't been launched recently
3. Background app refresh affects notification reliability
4. App Group storage operations are synchronous (acceptable for small data sizes)

### Implementation Notes

- Used singleton pattern for ScreenshotNotificationManager to ensure single observer registration
- Debouncing implemented via timestamp comparison (simple and reliable)
- Privacy-first: No screenshot content ever touches shared storage
- Storage limit (10 notifications) prevents unbounded growth
- Automatic cleanup on app launch and during writes
- Thread-safe operations using dedicated queue
- ObservableObject wrapper for SwiftUI lifecycle management
