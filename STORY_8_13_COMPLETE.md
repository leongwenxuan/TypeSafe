## Usage Example

```python
from app.agents.tools.company_verification import get_company_verification_tool

# Get singleton instance
tool = get_company_verification_tool()

# Verify company
result = await tool.verify_company("DHL Express SG", "SG")

# Check result
if result.legitimate:
    print(f"✅ Verified: {result.company_name}")
    print(f"Registration: {result.registration_number}")
    print(f"Confidence: {result.confidence}%")
else:
    print(f"⚠️ FAKE: {result.company_name}")
    print(f"Risk Level: {result.risk_level}")
    print(f"Patterns: {result.suspicious_patterns}")
```

## Real-World Scam Detection

### Example 1: Fake Courier Company ⚠️
```
Input: "DHL Express SG"
Result: HIGH RISK
- Not registered in Singapore
- Missing legal suffix "Pte Ltd"
- Similar to legitimate "DHL"
```

### Example 2: Tech Support Scam 🚨
```
Input: "Microsoft Security Department"
Result: HIGH RISK
- Not a registered entity
- Suspicious keyword: "department"
- Similar to legitimate "Microsoft"
```

### Example 3: Legitimate Company ✅
```
Input: "Apple Inc."
Result: LOW RISK
- Registered in US (SEC)
- Has legal suffix
- No suspicious patterns
```

## Integration with MCP Agent

### Before Story 8.13
```
Text → Entity Extractor → [phones, urls, emails] → MCP Agent → Verdict
```

### After Story 8.13
```
Text → Entity Extractor → [phones, urls, emails, companies] → MCP Agent → Verdict
                                                      ↓
                                         Company Verification Tool

## Known Limitations

1. **Online presence validation** - Structure in place, not fully implemented
   - Future: Integrate with web search API

2. **Canada/Australia registries** - Placeholder implementations

   - Future: Use user location or entity context

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Deploy to staging environment
2. ✅ Monitor performance and costs
3. ✅ Gather user feedback
