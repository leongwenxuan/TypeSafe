# Story 3.4: Backend Integration (Scan Image API)

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** companion app,  
**I want** to send OCR text and optional screenshot to backend,  
**so that** I can get AI-powered scam analysis results.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API client calls `POST /scan-image` with multipart form data
2. Sends session_id (anonymous UUID), ocr_text, and optional image
3. Session ID persisted in UserDefaults (per user, anonymous)
4. Image sent only if user opts in (privacy setting)
5. API call made asynchronously with loading indicator
6. Request timeout set to 4s
7. Network error handling with retry option
8. Results parsed and displayed in result view

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Create API Client Service (AC: 1, 2, 6, 7)
  - [x] Create APIService.swift in Services directory
  - [x] Implement POST /scan-image multipart form data request
  - [x] Add session ID generation and persistence in UserDefaults
  - [x] Configure 4-second request timeout as per architecture requirements
  - [x] Implement comprehensive network error handling with retry mechanism
  - [x] Add proper HTTP status code handling (400, 429, 500 errors)

- [x] Task 2: Implement Privacy-First Image Upload (AC: 2, 4)
  - [x] Add privacy setting toggle for image upload (default: OFF)
  - [x] Store privacy preference in UserDefaults
  - [x] Conditionally include image in multipart request based on user setting
  - [x] Always send OCR text regardless of image setting (privacy-first approach)
  - [x] Add clear user messaging about image upload implications

- [x] Task 3: Integrate API Client with OCR Flow (AC: 5, 8)
  - [x] Modify OCRTextPreviewView to call API after user confirms text
  - [x] Add loading state with progress indicator during API call
  - [x] Handle API response parsing to extract risk analysis results
  - [x] Navigate to result display view after successful API response
  - [x] Maintain OCR text editing capability before API submission

- [x] Task 4: Add Network Error Handling & Retry (AC: 7)
  - [x] Implement retry mechanism for failed network requests
  - [x] Add user-friendly error messages for different failure types
  - [x] Handle timeout scenarios with appropriate user feedback
  - [x] Add "Try Again" button for failed requests
  - [x] Log network errors for debugging (without sensitive data)

- [x] Task 5: Add Unit Tests for API Integration
  - [x] Create APIServiceTests.swift test file
  - [x] Test multipart form data construction
  - [x] Test session ID generation and persistence
  - [x] Test privacy setting integration
  - [x] Mock network responses for consistent testing
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios and retry logic

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.3 completion:
- OCRService and OCRTextPreviewView are implemented and working
- ScanView has proper state management for OCR processing
- OCR text extraction is complete and ready for backend submission
- User can edit OCR text before proceeding to analysis

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/public-api-backend.md#6.2]
- POST /scan-image endpoint accepts multipart form data
- Required fields: session_id, ocr_text
- Optional field: image (privacy-controlled)
- Returns: { risk_level, confidence, category, explanation }

[Source: architecture/data-flows.md#5.2]
- Screenshot scan flow: App receives screenshot → runs Vision OCR locally → POST /scan-image with OCR text
- Backend processes via Gemini (image+text) + OpenAI (text) → aggregate results
- Results persisted in Supabase with short retention

[Source: architecture/component-responsibilities.md#4.2]
- Companion App uploads OCR text + optionally image to backend for analysis
- Must handle multimodal analysis results from backend

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/security-privacy.md]
- Transport: HTTPS (TLS 1.3) required for all API calls
- Anonymization: session_id = random UUID, no PII
- Minimization: send only OCR text by default; screenshots optional
- Local-first: OCR on-device; screenshot upload is opt-in

[Source: architecture/performance-capacity.md]
- Performance target: < 3.5s for /scan-image endpoint
- Request timeout: 4s to allow for backend processing
- Graceful degradation if providers fail

### API Integration Details
[Source: architecture/appendix-example-swift-pseudocode.md]
- Example implementation pattern: uploadMultipart("/scan-image", fields: ["session_id": sessionId, "ocr_text": ocrText], file: image)
- Multipart form data construction required for image upload

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- API service: `TypeSafe/Services/APIService.swift` (new file)
- Network client: `TypeSafe/Networking/NetworkClient.swift` (if needed)
- Tests: `TypeSafeTests/APIServiceTests.swift`
- Integration point: Modify existing `TypeSafe/Views/OCRTextPreviewView.swift`

### iOS Framework Requirements
- URLSession for HTTP requests
- Foundation for multipart form data construction
- UserDefaults for session ID and privacy settings persistence
- Combine or async/await for asynchronous API calls

### Privacy Implementation
- Default image upload setting: OFF (privacy-first)
- Clear user consent required before enabling image upload
- Session ID generation using UUID() for anonymization
- No PII stored locally or transmitted to backend

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/observability-testing.md]
- Unit tests for API service functionality
- Mock network responses for reliable testing
- Test privacy setting integration
- Error scenario testing for network failures
- Performance testing to validate timeout handling

## Testing

### Test File Location
- `TypeSafeTests/APIServiceTests.swift` - Unit tests for API service
- Integration with existing `TypeSafeTests/` test suite structure

### Testing Framework
- XCTest framework for unit tests
- URLProtocol mocking for network request testing
- Combine testing for asynchronous operations

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test multipart form data construction with and without image
- Validate session ID generation and persistence
- Test privacy setting integration (image upload on/off)
- Test network error handling and retry mechanisms
- Verify timeout behavior matches 4-second requirement
- Test API response parsing and error scenarios
